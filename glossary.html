<h1>Glossary</h1>
<p><strong>Academic Qualification:</strong> A degree is any of a wide range of status levels conferred by institutions of an education, such as colleges and universities, normally as the result of successfully completing a program of study.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratio (ANER):</strong> Enrolment of the official age group for a given level of education either at that level or the levels above, expressed as a percentage of the population in that age group.</p>
<p><strong>Adult Literacy Rate:</strong> Number of literate persons aged 15 and above, expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group.</p>
<p><strong>Age-specific Enrolment Ratio (ASER):</strong> Enrolment of a given age or age group, regardless of the level of education in which pupils or students are enrolled, expressed as a percentage of the population of the same age or age group.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Education:</strong> The whole range of educational activities, taking place in various settings (formal, non‐formal and informal), that aim to meet basic learning needs.</p>
<p><strong>Compulsory Education:</strong> Educational programs that children and young people are legally obliged to attend, usually defined in terms of a number of grades or an age range, or both.</p>
<p><strong>Deeni Madaris:</strong> These are educational institutions in which formal religious education is provided. The degree provided by these institutions is equal to different levels of education provided by formal institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Dropout Rate by Grade:</strong> Percentage of students who drop out of a given grade in a given school year.</p>
<p><strong>Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE):</strong> Services and programs that support children’s survival, growth, development and learning – including health, nutrition and hygiene, and cognitive, social, emotional and physical development – from birth to entry into primary school.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong> A social science that encompasses teaching and learning specific knowledge, beliefs, and skills.</p>
<p><strong>Education Policy:</strong> Education policy is the collection of long term direction, commitments, intentions, rules, both stated and implicit, or the regulations, in practice that set the direction for education sector or a particular system or institutions. Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy.</p>
<p><strong>EFA Development Index (EDI):</strong> Composite index aimed at measuring overall progress towards EFA. At present, the EDI incorporates four of the most easily quantifiable EFA goals – universal primary education as measured by the primary adjusted net enrolment ratio; adult literacy as measured by the adult literacy rate; gender parity as measured by the gender-specific EFA index; and quality of education as measured by the survival rate to grade 5. Its value is the arithmetic mean of the observed values of these four indicators.</p>
<p><strong>Enrolment:</strong> Number of pupils or students enrolled at a given level of education, regardless of age.</p>
<p><strong>Enrolment by Stage:</strong> Enrolment by Stage defined as those students who are enrolled in one particular section of the school. For example primary stage enrolment not only includes classes 1 to 5 of Mosque &amp; Primary school but it also includes primary section of Middle, High &amp; Higher Secondary schools.</p>
<p><strong>Entrance Age (official):</strong> Age at which pupils or students would enter a given program or level of education assuming they had started at the official entrance age for the lowest level, studied full‐time throughout and progressed through the system without repeating or skipping a grade. The theoretical entrance age to a given program or level may be very different from the actual or even the most common entrance age.</p>
<p><strong>Gender Parity Index (GPI):</strong> Ratio of female to male values of a given indicator. A GPI between 0.97 and 1.03 indicates parity between the genders. A GPI below 0.97 indicates a disparity in favour of males. A GPI above 1.03 indicates a disparity in favour of females.</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> Stage of instruction usually equivalent to one complete school year.</p>
<p><strong>Graduate:</strong> A person who has successfully completed the final year of a level or sublevel of education.</p>
<p><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</strong> The value of all final goods and services produced in a country in one year (see also Gross National Product).</p>
