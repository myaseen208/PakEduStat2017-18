["message-from-federal-minister.html", "Message from Federal Minister", " Message from Federal Minister Education is the main source of human capital formation and a pre-requisite for socio-economic development of a country. The Prime Minister’s vision for a prosperous and progressive Pakistan hinges upon rapid human resource development. It is state’s obligation to ensure access and quality education to the masses, so that the citizens may realize their potentials and contribute productively at the national and international level. Availability of information/data plays a critical role in educational planning and decision making. Therefore, it is imperative to have complete, reliable and timely information/data. I am delighted to see that National Education Management Information System (NEMIS), working in the Academy of Educational Planning and Management (AEPAM), has compiled national education data and publishing Pakistan Education Statistics 2017-18. The report is a valuable and comprehensive document, which provides insight to the policy makers at national, provincial and even at international level. The present government is fully cognizant of the nexus between education and human resource development. Therefore, it has identified four priority areas, which include out of school children, uniform education system/National Common Curriculum, quality education and skill development. It is expected that this report will be an authentic source of information for all stakeholders to understand the current educational landscape along with challenges in Pakistan and to evolve effective strategies to tackle these challenges. The empirical evidence will not only help decision makers to address issues pertaining to access, equity, quality and governance of education sector, but also, facilitate them in monitoring the outcomes of various interventions. Human resource development is a pre-requisite to actualize the dream of knowledge based economy as well as for economic development and to compete in the globalized world. I appreciate the NEMIS team for compiling such a comprehensive report. I also express my special thanks to UNICEF, Pakistan for providing technical and financial support for preparation and launching of this report.         Mr. Shafqat Mahmood   Federal Minister for   Federal Education and Professional Training   Government of Pakistan   Islamabad "],

["foreword.html", "Foreword", " Foreword Government of Pakistan has introduced and implemented several policy interventions for development of Education in the country. Present government is taking every possible step to enhance access, equity, quality education and uniform education system across the country. Pragmatic planning can be designed with the help of accurate, reliable, valid and timely data to measure different education indicators. Education statistics also help to measure internal efficiency and effectiveness of the education system. In this context, it is expected that Pakistan Education Statistics 2017-18 shall be helpful in monitoring the progress relating to National and International Commitments especially Sustainable Development Goals. Pakistan Education Statistics report 2017-18 consists of two parts. Part-I include, an analysis of Education Statistics, introduction, an overview on education statistics, educational trends and effectiveness of the education system, whereas, Part-II include key indicators of Education Statistics, data on educational institutions, student enrolment, number and capacity of teachers and availability of physical facilities in the overall education system of the country. The focus of report is on analytical aspects of educational statistics such as educational trends, GIR, GER, ANER and Gender Parity Index (GPI). These indicators enable the policy makers to examine effectiveness of education system and measure the accessibility of education as well as identify deficient areas. This report also presents educational data regarding all categories of educational institutions both public and private including Deeni Madaris from pre-primary to tertiary level. Data regarding vocational and technical, teacher training and non-formal basic education institutions in the country has also been reported.

["introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Introduction 1.2 Education System in Pakistan 1.3 National Education Management Information System 1.4 Data Compilation Mechanism 1.5 Data Limitations 1.6 Data Sources", " 1 Introduction 1.1 Introduction The Islamic Republic of Pakistan came into being on 14th August 1947. It covers an area of about 796,096 \\(\\text{km}^{2}\\) and shares its borders with China, India, Iran and Afghanistan. Pakistan is located at a very strategically important position in South Asia. It connects the Eastern world with the West. It has friendly trade relations with China, an economic and technology giant, in its north. Afghanistan and Iran are in its west. India which shares long historical and cultural traditions with Pakistan lies in the East. It has a coastal belt of about 700 km, which connects it to the Middle East and provides a trade route through the Arabian Sea. Currently Pakistan is the fifth most populous country of the world. People who are daring and passionate make up to about 212 million of this country with a population density of 246 persons /\\(\\text{km}^{2}\\) (Pakistan Economic Survey, 2018-19). This country has been blessed with a variety of natural resources like salt, gypsum, coal, oil, copper and gold. Its physical features like its planes, deserts, northern highlands, lakes and rivers are not only a tourist’s attraction but are also related to renewable energy resources like Hydro-Power dams, Wind Power Energy Production and Solar Power Parks. Figure 1.1: Map of Pakistan showing different Provinces/Regions Pakistan is an agricultural country. Its major exports include agricultural products like cotton, sugar, rice, and textiles. Sports goods and leather products are widely accepted exports all over the world. The literacy rate of the country is nearly 62 percent while youth literacy rate is even better at 74 percent (Labour Force Servey, 2017-18). Urdu is the National language of Pakistan whereas English is used for education, trade and other administrative purposes all over the country. Pakistan is home of some of the earliest human civilizations in South Asia, including the Indus Valley and Gandhara civilizations. It lies between \\(23-35^{\\circ}\\) to \\(37-05^{\\circ}\\) north latitude and \\(60-50^{\\circ}\\) to \\(77-50^{\\circ}\\) east longitude. The principal source of water of Pakistan is the Indus River that starts in China, and runs through the whole length of Pakistan, coursing through the greater part of Pakistan’s areas aside from Balochistan. It is incremented further by the consolidated waters of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers. Along the Indus and its tributaries are majority of Pakistan’s populace horticultural zones, and its major hydroelectric power stations, interconnected by the rural waterways before it releases into the Arabian Sea. According to Human Development Report 2017, Pakistan’s Human Development Index (HDI) value is 0.562 — elevated from low human development to the medium human development category — positioning the country at 150th out of 189 countries and territories. Between 1990 and 2017, Pakistan’s HDI value increased from 0.404 to 0.562, an increase of 39 percent or average annual increase of about 1.4 percent. Pakistan’s 2017 HDI is below the average of 0.645 for countries in the medium human development group and also below the average of 0.638 for countries in South Asia. Since the state of education in the country is a major contributor in the formulation of HDI, therefore it is required that the government must focus and invest more resources for the development of education sector. 1.2 Education System in Pakistan The Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 lays down that State shall be responsible for eradication of illiteracy and provision of free and compulsory education up to secondary level, within minimum possible time (Article 37-B, 1973 Constitution of Pakistan) The Article 25-A – Right to Education – of the Constitution states that: The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to sixteen years in such manner as may be determined by law. Education is a fundamental human right and every child is entitled to it. Education is critical for the development of individuals and society, necessary for a successful and productive future. Provision of inclusive and equitable quality education, positively impacts future generations. However, education has not received due attention that it deserves in the national priorities. The present government has set up the following four strategic priority areas as: Decrease OOSC &amp; increase school participation Uniformity in education standards Improve the quality of education, and Enhance access to &amp; relevance of skills training The key to success would be putting in place necessary measures for achieving set targets, including increased allocation of financial as well as human resources for the education sector. There is need to bring in place national cohesion, effective use of available information, improved governance and financial efficiency/discipline as well as innovative use of technology and communication to revamp the existing system of education according to the needs of modern era. The state has the responsibility to equip its young people with knowledge, creativity, critical thinking, technical and leadership skills so that they can play a responsible role as global citizens both nationally and internationally. Pakistan, along with other countries of the world has signed the Sustainable Development Goals Agenda 2030. SDG-4 relates to quality education and lifelong learning. Various levels and dimensions of monitoring frameworks have been defined to better monitor the SDG-4 at national and global levels. The monitoring system that provides in-depth specifics of education system offers greater opportunities to policy makers for their unique circumstances and development priorities. As Pakistan was unable to achieve the Education For All (EFA) agenda by 2015, unfinished business of EFA will be an integral part of SDGs Agenda 2030. On the EFA Education Development Index (EDI) published in EFA Global Monitoring Report 2015, Pakistan lies at the bottom in the region. A similar picture is painted by the gross enrolment ratios that combine all education sectors, and by the adult literacy rate measures. According to data from the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2017-18, the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) shows Pakistan’s weak performance being ranked 129th of the 137 countries, on the Health and Primary Education related elements of competitiveness, when compared with other countries in the region like India, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The structure of school education system in public sector is depicted in Fig. 1.2. Figure 1.2: The structure of school education system in Pakistan (Pre-Primary to Higher Secondary 1.3 National Education Management Information System The Academy of Educational Planning and Management (AEPAM) was established in 1982, mainly assigned with the responsibilities of capacity building of educational planners and managers, consolidating and collating education statistics, maintaining comprehensive national educational database and conducting policy research to facilitate preparation of educational policies. The National Education Management Information System (NEMIS) was established in 1990 with the responsibility to collate, consolidate, and analyze national education data and generate useful information to cater to the needs of policy makers, planners, education managers and decision makers. Since 1992-93, NEMIS has been publishing Pakistan Education Statistics on annual basis. NEMIS is also providing educational data and indicators to the Government of Pakistan as well as other relevant stakeholders and UN Agencies under its global commitments. After the devolution of Ministry of Education as a result of 18th Constitutional Amendment, NEMIS came on the front and took the major responsibilities of the defunct Policy and Planning Wing of devolved Ministry of Education. NEMIS is also publishing the following reports on annual basis: Pakistan Education Atlas District Education Profiles 1.4 Data Compilation Mechanism The Provincial/Area EMIS units are responsible for collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination of education statistics/data of their respective provinces/areas. These units usually collect data through their district EMIS cells by conducting Annual School Census (ASC). The 35th Technical Committee (TechCOM) Meeting of NEMIS was held on 2nd May, 2019 at AEPAM, Islamabad. This meeting was followed by 21st Coordination Committee (CoordCOM) on 3rd May, 2019 at the same venue and participants of the TechCOM were also present in the CoordCOM Meeting. During TechCOM meeting, the technical members of provincial/area EMIS’s transformed their data into NEMIS database while members of CoordCOM meeting endorsed the numbers/data provided/compiled during TechCOM meeting. 1.5 Data Limitations The numbers shown in this publication were tabulated from National EMIS databank developed by National Education Management Information System. These data have some limitations that need to be mentioned. The data from private sector of education, for the provinces/regions of Sindh and Balochistan, used in this publication is based on estimation on National Education Census (NEC) data collected during NEC 2005-06. AJK EMIS has provided private sector data. The current population census was conducted in 2017. However, the data of the population census has not yet been released by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. Therefore, projected population data provided by National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS) based on 1998 population census is used in this publication to calculate different indicators for Pakistan Education Statistics 2017-18. 1.6 Data Sources The following data sources have been used for compilation of this report: Provincial/Regional EMISs National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS) National Education Census 2005‐06 Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) Higher Education Commission (HEC) Provincial Higher Education departments National Vocational &amp; Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), Islamabad National &amp; Provincial Education Foundations National Commission for Human Development (NCHD) Directorate of Basic Education Community Schools (BECS) Provincial Departments of Non‐Formal Basic Education Other Public Sector departments National &amp; Provincial Special Education departments Rabita-al-Madaris Islamia Wafaq-ul-Madaris Al-Salafia Tanzeem-ul-Madaris Ahle-Sunat Wafaq-ul-Madaris Al-Shia Wafaq-ul-Madaris Al-Arabia "],
["education-statistics-an-overview.html", "2 Education Statistics: An Overview 2.1 Education Statistics by Categories of Institutions 2.2 Universities &amp; Degree Awarding Institutions", " 2 Education Statistics: An Overview Education plays a pivotal role in socio-economic development of a nation. Education not only helps in nurturing and personality development of children but it also prepares them for their future roles as responsible and productive citizens of the country. After insertion of Article 25-A in the Constitution of Pakistan under the 18th Constitutional Amendment, free education has become a fundamental and legal right and provision of free and compulsory education to all children of age group 5-16 years has become the responsibility of the state. Education has been recognized and guaranteed as a basic human right by United Nations under Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Government of Pakistan is fully cognizant about the importance of education, therefore each successive government has invested in education for numerous reasons i.e. human capital development, economic growth, human rights, promotion of good citizenship and to strengthen equal opportunity to its populace. In addition acquiring education is linked to poverty reduction as it imparts knowledge and skills to enhance the productivity of labour force. Therefore, provision and financing of education has remained the primary responsibility of the state of Pakistan. Historically, in Pakistan, commitment of the state to social service delivery, education in particular, has often competed with heavy debt repayments, large and ever-expanding defense budget needs and unproductive expenditures on running oversized public sector enterprises. Pakistan’s schooling system consists of three main school types namely public sector schools, private sector schools and Deeni Madaris. These are further divided as public and private mainly due to curriculum and examination systems used in the schools and the language of instructions used by teachers. Figure 2.1: Percentage distribution of Institutions, Enrolment and Teachers by Sector 2017-18 The education system of Pakistan is comprised of 305,763 institutions accommodating 51,835,089 students and 2,073,433 teachers. The system is composed of 189,748 (62%) public institutions and 116,015 (38%) private institutions, which also include 31,115 Deeni Madaris. The public sector is serving 29.24 million (56%) students to complete their education while the remaining 22.70 million (44%) are enrolled in the private sector of education. About 38 percent private educational institutions are facilitating 44 percent of students showing a slightly higher per-institution enrolment ratio in the private sector compared to the public sector. In the last decade due to encouragement of the government there is a gradual growth of opening of educational institutions in the private sector. In terms of teaching staff, 46 percent of teachers work in the public sector institutions, compared to 54 percent in the private sector (including 8% teachers serving in the Deeni Madaris) (Fig. 2.1). Education is seen as a major force for eliminating gender inequities within the society, though addressing inequalities within the education system itself is a tremendous challenge. Ratio of male teachers is higher in public sector whereas ratio of female teachers is higher in private sector. Gender composition of the enrolled students is 56 percent males compared to 44 percent female students, whereas there are 40 percent male and 60 percent female teachers imparting education upto the degree colleges in the year 2017-18 (Fig. 2.2). Figure 2.2: Percentage distribution of Enrolment and Teachers by Gender 2017-18 Percentage distribution of institutions, enrolment and number of teachers upto the degree colleges for provinces/regions by sector is given in the Fig. 2.3. At the national level the percentage difference in the public and private sectors is 38, 26 and 4 percent for institutions, enrolment &amp; teachers respectively. This disparity is maximum (86%) in Balochistan and GB for institutional divide in favour of public sector 64 and 58 percent for FATA and Balochistan for enrolment divide and 68 and 60 percent again for FATA and Balochistan for teacher divide. It may also be noticed that in ICT private sector has sizeable edge in favour of all three determinants. In GB there were two percent more teachers in private sector. In AJK there were more percentage of institutions, enrolment and teachers in the private sector. Percentage distribution of enrolment and teachers for provinces/regions by gender is given in the Fig. 2.4. It is observed that enrolment percentages are higher by twelve percent for males as compared to females at the national level. This difference is two percent for ICT, about 20 percent in Sindh, KP and Balochistan and maximum of 38 percent in FATA. There are about 20 percent more female teachers imparting education to students upto the degree colleges. It seems that this domination is due to the private sector where comparatively more female teachers are hired as compared to male teachers for lower classes. In Punjab, Sindh, AJK, and ICT there are 40, 6, 6 and 52 percent more female teachers as compared to male teachers respectively. Figure 2.3: Percentage distribution of Institutions, Enrolment and Teachers by Sector and Provinces/Regions 2017-18 Figure 2.4: Percentage distribution of Enrolment and Teachers by Gender and Provinces/Regions 2017-18 2.1 Education Statistics by Categories of Institutions The educational institutions in the country are divided into following categories: Pre-Primary Primary Middle High Higher Secondary Inter-Colleges Degree Colleges Universities Technical &amp; Vocational Institutions Teacher Training Institutions Non-Formal Basic Education Education Foundations Deeni Madaris The following sections, present an overview of the country’s education system in terms of these categories of educational institutions. These broad categories will be further analyzed on the basis of sector, gender and education level. From Pre-Primary to university level this can be broadly categorized into three levels, namely School Education (Pre-Primary - Class 12) College Education (Degree Colleges, Class 13-14) University Education The formal education system comprises of 223,116 institutions out of which 137,460 (61%), 46,665 (21%), 31,392 (14%), 5,754 (3%) and 1,845 (1%) represent Primary (including pre-primary), middle, high, higher secondary and degree colleges/universities respectively. The percentage distribution of educational institutions upto higher secondary/inter college level is shown in Fig. 2.5 which gives public/private sector divide for the given categories of education at national as well as provinces/regions level. Figure 2.5: Percentage distribution of Institutions by Sector and Provinces/Regions 2017-18 It is observed that at primary level 87 percent institutions are in the public sector, while only 13 percent are in the private sector. For the middle, high and higher secondary level private sector has more institutions as compared to public sector. Provinces/Regions portray similar picture at primary level except in ICT where there are more primary schools in private sector. Disparities can be observed at different stages which must be taken into account by the policy planners for bringing correction in the institutional divide. 2.1.1 School Education Separate pre-primary institutions don’t exist in the public sector of Pakistan, however, admissions in pre-primary are given in public sector schools. The total enrolment at pre-primary stage is 9.489 million. Public sector has an enrolment of 4.830 million (51%), whereas the private sector has 4.659 million (49%). There are a total of 137,079 primary schools in the country out of these 119,202 (87%) are in the public sector, whereas, 17,877 (13%) are in the private sector. The primary stage of education in Pakistan enrols 18.664 million students. Out of which 12.065 million (65%) are in public sector and 6.599 million (35%) are in private sector (Fig. 2.5). Out of the total enrolment at primary stage, 10.424 million (56%) are male and 8.239 million (44%) are females. In the provinces of Sindh, KP and Balochistan and FATA region more than ninety percent institutions at the primary level were in the public sector and less than ten percent in the private sector. ICT has more than twice schools at the primary level in the private sector as compared to the public sector (Fig. 2.6). Figure 2.6: Percentage distribution of Enrolment by Sector and Provinces/Regions 2017-18 There is more enrolment in public sector at primary level in all provinces/regions except AJK and ICT where the percentage is (44:56) for public vs private for both regions. Since there is no separate allocation of teachers to the pre-primary level in the public sector, their number is not reported. Whereas the private sector has separate teachers for pre-primary sector and the reported number of teachers is 2,117. At national level, there are 46,665 middle schools of which 16,550 (35%) are in public sector, whereas 30,115 (65%) are in private sector. In Punjab, Sindh and ICT there are more schools in private sector as compared to public sector (Fig. 2.5). A total of 6.422 million students are enrolled in middle level of education i.e., they are studying in grades VI-VIII. Out of these 4.239 million (66%) are in public sector, whereas, 2.184 million (34%) are in private sector. This pattern is also followed in all provinces/regions except AJK where there are more middle schools in private sector (Fig. 2.6). Figure 2.7: Percentage distribution of Enrolment by Gender and Provinces/Regions 2017-18 The enrolment distribution of male and female at middle level is 3.601 (56%) and 2.821 (44%) million respectively. The pattern is followed in the provinces/regions with disparity in FATA and KP (Fig. 2.7). The total number of teachers at middle level is 448,074 out of which 140,946 (31%) teachers are performing their duties in public sector while the remaining 307,128 (69%) are serving in the private schools (Fig. 2.8). There are 129,756 (29%) male and 325,689 (71%) female teachers, in middle schools. This pattern of more female teachers is observed for Punjab, Sindh, ICT and AJK while there are more teachers in other provinces/regions at middle school level (Fig. 2.9). Figure 2.8: Percentage distribution of Teachers by Sector and Provinces/Regions 2017-18 Figure 2.9: Percentage distribution of Teachers by Gender and Provinces/Regions 2017-18 There are a total of 31,392 high schools in the country. Out of these 13,448 (43%) schools are in the public sector, whereas 17,944 (57%) are in the private sector (Fig. 2.5). The total enrolment at high school stage is 3.349 million, of which 2.353 million (70%) is in public sector, whereas, 0.996 million (30%) is in private sector (Fig. 2.6). The total enrolment of males at high schools is 1.925 million (56%), whereas, the female enrolment is 1.424 million (44%). The total teachers at high school level are 563,302, out of which 247,447 (44%) are in public and 315,855 (56%) are in private sector (Fig. 2.8). There are 218,064 (39%) male and 342,578 (61%) female teachers at this level (Fig. 2.9). There are 5,754 higher secondary schools/inter colleges in education system of Pakistan. The share of these institutions in overall education system of the country is about three percent, out of which one-third are in public sector. The total enrolment in higher secondary schools is 1.682 million out of which 89% is in public sector schools (Fig. 2.6). There are 0.921 (54%) males and 0.761 (46%) million female students (Fig. 2.7). There are 123,154 teachers working in higher secondary schools/inter colleges out of which 62,739 (51%) are in public sector (Fig. 2.8). There are 48 percent male and 52 percent female teachers teaching higher secondary/inter college level (Fig. 2.9). A pictorial comparison of percentage distribution of number of institutions, enrolment and teachers by level of education is given in Fig 2.10. At primary level schooling there are 62 percent of institutions, with 67 percent of enrolment and having 28 percent of teachers of the entire education system in Pakistan. The point of concern for policy makers is the low percentage of teachers available for primary education when minor children need more attention from their teachers. The public sector portrays 78 percent institutions, with 63 percent enrolment and 41 percent teachers at primary which is better than the overall picture. However the private sector contributing with 26 percent institutions, and teachers 14 percent educating much higher percentage of students (75%) at primary level. The governing bodies of the private sector institutions need to take corrective measures to improve the quality of education at the very basic tier of the education system. At middle level the institution, enrolment and teacher percentage triplet is 21:15:26 which is more balanced as compared to the primary level. The private sector triplet is (43:14:37) as compared to public sector (11:16:16). Figure 2.10: Percentage distribution of Institutions, Enrolment and Teachers by Education level and Sector 2017-18 At high schools level the ratio percent triplet is 14:8:33 for percentage of institutions, enrolment and teachers at the national level. In the public sector the ratio percent triplet is 9:9:28 and for private sector it is 26:7:38. The number of institutions and teachers in the public sector are lesser than institutions in private sector but having small enrolment percentage and high teacher percentage. At inter-college and higher education level the percentages are too small to be displayed in the pie charts as the slices are very small. The overall ratio percent triplet for inter college level is 3:4:7 while its public/private segregation is 1:6:7 for public and 5:1:7 for private sector for institutions, enrolment and teachers respectively. For higher education (Degree College and University both) the overall ratio percent triplet is 1.1:6:5 for institutions, enrolment and teachers respectively. 2.1.2 Degree Colleges There are 1,659 degree colleges of which 1,498 (90%) are in public sector, whereas 161 (10%) are in private sector (Fig. 2.12). The total enrolment at degree college stage i.e. in grades 13 and 14, is 0.605 million. Out of these students 0.473 million (79%) are completing their degrees from public sector, whereas, 0.132 million (21%) students are in private sector (Fig. 2.13). The total male enrolment at degree college stage is 0.310 million (51%), whereas, enrolment for female is 0.295 million (49%) (Fig. 2.11). The total teachers at degree college level are 41,233 out of which 38,853 (94%) are in public and 2,380 (6%) are in private sector (Fig. 2.14). There are 23,430 (57%) male and 17,803 (43%) female teachers in the degree colleges of the country (Fig. 2.15). Figure 2.11: Percentage distribution of Enrolment in Institutions of higher, technical, non-formal, education foundation and Deeni Madaris education by Gender 2017-18 2.2 Universities &amp; Degree Awarding Institutions There are a total of 186 universities &amp; degree awarding institutions catering to the needs of higher degree students in both public and private sectors of education. Out of these universities, 111 (60%) are working under umbrella of public sector, whereas 75 (40%) are working in the private sector. Figure 2.12: Percentage distribution of Institutions of higher, technical, non-formal, education foundation and Deeni Madaris education by Sector 2017-18 The total enrolment in the universities and degree awarding institutions is 1.576 million. Out of this 1.266 million (80%) students are enrolled in public sector whereas, 0.309 million (20%) students are studying in private universities and degree awarding institutions (Fig. 2.13). In the overall national scenario only four percent students have access to university education. The total male enrolment in the universities is 0.881 million (56%), whereas, the female enrolment is 0.695 million (44%) (Fig. 2.11). There are 56,885 teachers imparting higher education to the students in these universities. Universities in the public sector employ 38,011 (67%) teachers while those in the private sector have 18,874 (33%) teachers (Fig. 2.14). Figure 2.13: Percentage distribution of Enrolment in Institutions of higher, technical, non-formal and Deeni Madaris education by Sector 2017-18 2.2.1 Non-Formal Basic Education Non-Formal Basic Education (NFBE) comprises of a number of departments like Basic Education Community Schools (BECS), National Commission for Human Development (NCHD), Punjab Literacy &amp; NFBE Department, Sindh Education and Literacy Department (SELD), Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), Balochistan Literacy and NFE Department and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs). This segment has been a significant feature of policy debates around education in many countries for three decades. It has drawn attention to the importance and potential of education, learning and training that takes place outside recognized educational institutions. According to Pakistan Education Statistics Report 2016-17, 22.8 million children (44%) between the ages of 5 and 16 were out of schools in Pakistan, though the number has reduced to 17.8 million this year. It is important to note that out of school children of 5-9 years are only 22 percent whereas remaining cohort of 10-16 years of age constitutes 78 percent. This age cohort signifies a huge range of diversity and complexity with reference to their education. Most of them have become overage owing to missing early years of schooling or drop out from schools before completing primary or elementary education cycle. Children belonging to this particular age cohort have to face difficulty in readmission in schools owing to formal school policy. Therefore, they necessarily require a second chance to educate themselves and re-enter the educational mainstream to complete basic education and continue their education from sixth grade or through distance learning from AIOU. Under second chance education phenomenon NFBE provides options in the form of an alternative education model that are flexible, fast track and equivalent education. Such models are known as Accelerated Education Programs (AEPs)/Accelerated Learning Programs (ALPs). These model serve the learning needs of a specific group of out-of-school children especially those who missed their early school years or dropped out before completing primary or elementary education cycle. Figure 2.14: Percentage distribution of Teachers in Institutions of higher, technical, non-formal and Deeni Madaris education by Sector 2017-18 The NFBE work under AEP/ALP model which is one teacher and one room, where the space is generally provided by the community and is highly inclusive in nature. It addresses diversity by including the excluded especially refugees, IDPs and those with minor or moderate learning difficulties through multi-grade, multi-age, and multi-language teaching and learning approaches. Teachers’ professional qualification is low, but their capacity is enhanced through extensive and enabling in-service Continuous Professional Development (CDP) methods. Class timings are flexible and are offered as per the availability of learners in condensed and accelerated time frame. The primary model offers primary cycle in 32-36 months while elementary model offers this cycle in 18-24 months including selected skill courses. The assessment and examination is carried out through authorized assessment bodies for equivalence and valid certificates, which ensure continuing education and mainstreaming. This model is highly participative and involves community in all its operations for sustainability and lasting impact. Considering the current circumstances, this model is suitable for being in-expensive. The cost per child per month ranges from Rs.300-500. Therefore, this model can be adopted to address the issue of out-of-school children with minimum financial inputs. There are 35,059 institutions imparting non-formal basic education in the country in the public sector. Students enrolled in NFBE are 1.425 million with 0.727 million (54%) and 0.699 million (46%) males and females respectively. There are 33,990 serving teachers, out of which 34 percent are male and 66 percent female teachers (Fig. 2.15). 2.2.2 Technical &amp; Vocational Education Training Institutions Technical and Vocational Education &amp; Training (TVET) is basically the skill-development of workforce working in the different sectors of economy of a country. It is also defined as marketable and economically relevant education for people. Technical Education refers to post-secondary courses of study and practical training aimed at preparation of technicians to work as supervisory staff. Vocational Training, on the other hand, refers to the lower-level education and training for the preparation of skilled or semi-skilled workers in various trades, but it does not enhance their level with respect to general education. There is a fresh awareness among policy makers in developing countries and the international community of the critical role that TVET can play in national development. One of the most important features of TVET is its orientation towards the world of work and the emphasis of the curriculum on the acquisition of employable skills. TVET delivery systems are therefore well placed to train the skilled and entrepreneurial workforce that the country needs to create wealth and alleviate poverty. TVET is important because TVET institutions can respond to the different training needs of learners from different socio-economic and academic backgrounds, and prepare them for gainful employment and sustainable livelihoods. The youth, the poor and the vulnerable of society can therefore directly benefit from TVET programs. In a developing country like Pakistan, it is extremely important to realize that large number of young people are outside the formal school system, requiring the integration of non-formal learning methodologies and literacy programs into national education system. To revitalize, modernize and harmonize TVET in order to transform it into a mainstream activity for the youth development and human capacity building in Pakistan the present Government has included skills development as one of the priority areas in its education policy. In Pakistan, there are 3,740 technical and vocational institutions, of which 1,627 (44%) are in public sector, whereas 2,113 (56%) are in private sector (Fig. 2.12). This is roughly 1.23 percent in the overall institutional scenario of the country. It needs much more focus of the government as this is an era of skill development which can contribute much more in the country’s economic development. Figure 2.15: Percentage distribution of Teachers in Institutions of higher, technical, non-formal and Deeni Madaris education by Gender 2017-18 The total enrolment in the technical and vocational institutions is 0.433 million, of which 0.277 million (64%) is in the public sector, whereas, 0.156 million (36%) is in the private sector (Fig. 2.13). Less than one percent students are enrolled in TVETT institutions in the overall student enrolment at the national level which is quite low percentage for skill development education. This area needs much better focus of the government. It is also observed that 44 percent public technical &amp; vocational institutions are serving 64 percent of total technical &amp; vocational enrolment, while 56 percent private institutions are serving 36 percent of the private sector enrolment in the country. The total male enrolment in the technical and vocational institutions is 0.225 million (65%), whereas, the female enrolment is 0.119 million (35%). The total teachers in the technical and vocational institutions are 18,207, out of those 9,164 (50%) are in public and 9,043 (50%) are in private sector (Fig. 2.14). There are 13,903 (76%) male teachers and 4,304 (24%) female teachers (Fig. 2.15). 2.2.3 Teachers Training Institutions There are 217 teachers training institutions, of which 158 (73%) are in the public sector and only 59 (27%) are in the private sector (Fig. 2.12). The total enrolment at teachers training institutions is 0.724 million, of which 0.719 million (99%) are in public sector, whereas, 0.005 million (01%) are in private sector (Fig. 2.13). The total male enrolment in the teachers training institutions is 0.481 million (66%), whereas, the female enrolment is 0.243 million (34%) (Fig. 2.11). The total teachers in the teachers training institutions are 3,791, out of which 3,493 (92%) are in public and 298 (8%) are in private sector (Fig. 2.14). 2.2.4 Education Foundations There are five Education Foundations working in the country in the private sector. They are National Education Foundation (NEF), Punjab Education Foundation (PEF), Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), KP Elementary and Secondary Education Foundation (KPESEF) and Balochistan Education Foundation (BEF). Under the umbrella of these Education Foundations there are 12,516 institutions working for educating children for elementary and secondary education. More than 60 percent of these institutions are working in the Punjab province, while more than 16 percent each are in Sindh and KP. Balochistan Education Foundation control five percent of the educational foundation institutions which are limited to female children only. NEF, BEF and SEF closed one, one and 91 institutions this year while Punjab, and KPESEF increased 510 and 781 institutions respectively. There were 3.367 million enrolments during the year 2017-18 in these Education Foundation institutions which increased by about 22 percent over the previous year. The major share of this enrolment jump is due to about 26 and 171 percent increase in Punjab and KP respectively. The enrolment of female students in KPESEF was 64 percent as compared to male students (34%). In Punjab and Sindh the enrolment percentage was (55:45) and (59:41) for males and females respectively. Student-Teacher ratio was 29:1 at the national level while it varied a lot with respect to different foundations. It was 26:1 for NEF, 28:1 for PEF, 33:1 for SEF, 43:1 for KPESEF and 14:1 for BEF. There is need to further strengthen these Education Foundations to address the problem of OOSC and also encourage public-private partnership (Table 6.12). 2.2.5 Deeni Madaris Traditionally, Deeni Madaris are Islamic learning institutions, aimed at producing Islamic scholars and leaders. Deeni Madaras provide free religious education, boarding and lodging to their learners. For these reasons, they are essentially schools for the poor. Their students learn how to read, memorize and recite the Holy Qur’an properly. They issue certificates of various levels which are also recognized by the government. A Dar-Ul-Ulum usually having hundred of students is their university level while a Maktab having about fifty students is equivalent to a primary school. The graduating students are called Haffiz-ul-Qur’an (those who memorize the Arabic text of the Qur’an) or Qaris (those who can recite Qur’anic verses with proper Arabic pronunciation). Ulema (Religious Scholars) are those who have advanced theological training in religious studies. Present government is taking lot of interest in revamping these institutions to bring them closer to the mainstream education system by including contemporary subjects like English, Urdu, Mathematics, and Science etc. in their curriculum in addition to the routine religious teachings. Currently, there are 31,115 Deeni Madaris working in Pakistan. All of these religious institutions are working under the umbrella of the private sector. The total enrolment in the Deeni Madaris is 4.099 million. More than 0.179 million teachers are serving in these Deeni Madaras. The total male enrolment in Deeni Madaris is 2.362 million (58%), whereas, the female enrolment is 1.737 million (42%) (Fig. 2.11). There are 140,950 (79%) male and 38,453 (21%) female teachers imparting religious education to the students from primary to master’s level (Fig. 2.15). "],
["trends-in-education-statistics.html", "3 Trends in Education Statistics 3.1 Institutions 3.2 Enrolment 3.3 Teachers", " 3 Trends in Education Statistics This chapter focuses on the analysis of data collected through Annual School Census (ASC) over the last five years. The intent is to discern any pattern in the values collected during this time period for the purpose of future planning and decision making. The indicators used in this comparative analysis cover the census years 2013-14 to 2017-18, a five year time series to study trends in education. The basic components of education, including institutions, enrolment and teachers at National level are highlighted in this chapter. Since ASC focuses on public sector institutions of primary to higher secondary levels. Data on private sector was also compiled and a comparison of trend over the last five years is discussed/presented below. 3.1 Institutions Educational institution (school) is one of the major components of any education system. This part of the chapter focuses on the comparison of public/private sector educational institutions of primary to higher secondary levels. At primary level a seven percent decline in the number of public school occurred. This decline was even more (9%) over the last year. Possible reason for this decline may be: Up-gradation of primary schools to higher levels Closing of non-functional schools, as per rationalization policy of the government Merger of schools, due to non-availability of teachers or lack of enrolment. In the private sector there was a marginal increase of about 256 schools over the last five year period. The number of schools at primary level in the private sector rose to 20,256 in 2015-16 which dropped to 17,877 in 2017-18, showing a 13 percent decrease over the last three years. Figure 3.1: Five Years Comparison of number of Schools by Education level from 2013-14 to 2017-18 At the middle level the number of public schools remain almost constant. However, there is a 14 percent increase in the number of middle schools in the private sector. The number of high schools both in public and private sectors remains stagnant with the number of public high schools fluctuating around 13,000 and private high schools around 18,000. A very significant increase in the number of higher secondary schools in the public sector was observed. In 2013-14 there were 1,768 higher secondary schools in the public sector which rose to 2,095 in 2017-18 with an increase of about 18 percent over the last five years. In the private sector the corresponding increase over the same period was about seven percent. The major reason for these increases was due to the up-gradation at different levels (Fig. 3.1). 3.2 Enrolment At the pre-primary stage of education there were 9.49 million enrolments out of which 4.83 million students were enrolled in public sector schools while the remaining 51 percent were in the private sector schools. The number remained almost similar over the last five years. For private schools the enrolment during 2013-14 was 3.716 million which increased to 4.660 million in 2017-18 showing an increase of 25 percent which is a matter of concern for the government (Table 7.1). At the pre-primary stage of education, an increase of about eight and seven percent has been observed against 2015-16 in enrolment of males and females respectively. At primary stage of education an increase of 4.4 percent was recorded over the last five years in public and private institutions enrolment. Figure 3.2: Five Years Comparison of Enrolment by Education level, Sector and Gender from 2013-14 to 2017-18 At middle stage of education, a decrease of one percent in the enrolment of males and an increase of two percent in the enrolment of females has been observed during 2017-18. In 2013-14, there were 1.12 million males and 0.76 million females enrolled at High-Stage of education all over the country. With the passage of five years, in 2017-18, the high stage of education has enrolled 1.92 million males and 1.42 million females. This shows an increase of 11.3 and 17.7 percent in males and females enrolment, respectively, over the time. An eleven percent increase in the enrolment is observed over the last five years. A very significant increase of 17 percent in the enrolment at the higher secondary stage has been observed all over the country. In School Census year 2013-14, 1.17 million students were enrolled at higher secondary education stage all over the country. Five years later, in 2017-18, the public sector of education in the country enrolled 1.37 million students in higher secondary education. Five year comparison of enrolment by public/private as well as male/female is depicted in Fig. 3.2. There are similar patterns in the pre-primary, middle and high school enrolments for both public and private schools for male and female enrolments. However, there is a decline from 2016-17 to 2017-18 for private schools at primary, middle and high school levels. There are more fluctuations in the enrolment of public and private institutions by gender in the higher secondary level and at higher education level. In HEC institutions enrolment of both genders increased from 2015-16 to 2017-18 which is an indication of students now joining private sector institutions of higher learning. Five years trend from 2013-14 to 2017-18 of GER at national level show a 12, 4 and 9 percent increase at primary, middle and secondary levels respectively. In the ANER a very small one percent increase over the five years at primary level was observed. A sharp increase at middle and secondary level of ANER values showed 23 and 20 percent over the last year is observed due to change in the methodology of adjustment which is now based on a random sample survey for age specific information conducted by NEMIS (Fig. 3.3). Figure 3.3: Five Years Comparison of Gross and Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratios by Education level from 2013-14 to 2017-18 3.3 Teachers Currently, the overall public sector education system is being served by 0.944 million teachers while five years earlier the system had the services of 0.830 million teachers, indicating that over this time period, 13 percent more teachers were added to the system. Much higher increase in the number of teachers is noticed in the private sector where the number of teachers increased from 0.764 million in 2013-14 to 1.130 million in 2017-18 showing a 48 percent growth in the last five years. This is mainly due to the establishment of educational foundations hiring new teachers in Punjab, KP, and also by an increase of about one hundred thousand teachers in Deeni Madaris. There is sizeable increase over the last five years in the induction of new teachers in the formal education system with the highest increase of 34 percent at the primary level in the private sector. The corresponding increase in the public sector was 16 percent. At the middle school level also there was more increase in the private sector (31%) as compared to public sector (9%). A decrease in the number of teachers in the private sector was observed at the inter college level. Figure 3.4: Five Years Comparison of number of Teachers by Education level, Sector and Gender from 2013-14 to 2017-18 At middle schools although slight decrease of 0.9 percent has been observed in male teachers and 1.4 percent in female teachers, as compared to 2015-16, but a five percent overall increase is evident over the last five years. In high schools, the number of teachers has also increased over the last five years. The number of high school teachers has risen to 238,633 from 210,114 since the census year 2013-14, i.e., an increase of 14 percent during the last five years. Higher Secondary Schools have seen an increase of 27 percent in the teachers during last five years with figure reaching upto 59,655 from 47,079 (Table 8.2). The Fig. 3.4 shows trends in number of teachers employed by public and private sector with respect to gender for different stages of school education. It is obvious that at all levels there are more male teachers in the public sector except in middle stage for the last three years when females out numbered male teachers. The trend over the five year period is also increasing. In the private sector female teachers are many more as compared to male teachers at all stages. "],
["effectiveness-of-education-system.html", "4 Effectiveness of Education System 4.1 Access in Education 4.2 Equity in Education 4.3 Quality in Education", " 4 Effectiveness of Education System In the path to economic development, education has become a central element of the country’s growth strategies. To be effective in the long run, improvements in education need to enable all children to have access to quality education without discrimination, to stay in the system until at least at the end of higher secondary education, and to achieve the skills and knowledge they will need for effective social and labour market integration. Access, Equity and Quality of education are very important considerations for analyzing the effectiveness of the education system. For each of these important parameters, there are a number of indicators which can determine the level of access, equity and quality in education system. 4.1 Access in Education 4.1.1 Gross Intake Rate (GIR) Gross Intake Rate (GIR) is defined as total number of new entrants in the first grade of primary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population at the official primary school-entrance age. A high GIR indicates in general a high degree of access to primary education. As this calculation includes all new entrants to the first grade, including over-aged and under-aged children entering primary school for the first time, the value of GIR can be more than 100 percent. At the national level GIR for 2017-18 remained unchanged at 98 percent. However GIR in the provinces/regions showed increase/decrease. It showed increase in Punjab, AJK and ICT and decrease in all other provinces/regions. GIR for males (105) was 13 percent higher than females (92). This difference was high in KP (20%) and FATA (38%) than other provinces/regions (Fig. 4.1). It was the lowest in Punjab where only one percent difference between male and female GIR was observed. Figure 4.1: GIR by Gender for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 4.1.2 Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) The GER is the most commonly used indicator to measure coverage in the education system. GER is defined as the number of students, regardless of age, enrolled in a specific school phase (e.g. primary phase for class 1 to 5) as a percentage of the total appropriate school-age population (e.g. age \\(5-9^{+}\\) years old for the primary phase). For example, a GER of more than 100 percent indicates that there are more students in the formal schooling system than in the appropriate school-age population (total potential population), which is evidence of enrolment of under-aged and over-aged students owing to early or late entry and grade repetition. It shows the overall coverage of an education system in relation to the population eligible for participation in the enrolment in schools. It is useful for those who are interested in the overall participation rate of the school-age population in a particular education level. It can be used for comparing different provinces, regions, urban and rural, male and female disparities, etc. Gross enrolment in primary education is 22.931 million with 12.838 million (56%) males and 10.093 million (44%) females. In order to compute GER population of official primary school age is required. Since the Population Census 2017 official figures are yet to be finalized so population projections by NIPS 2005-25 were used for this purpose. According to these projections the projected population figures at national level for age group ( \\(5-9^{+}\\) years) were 22.572 million with 11.714 million (51.9%) males and 10.858 million (49.1%) females. Resultantly GER for Pakistan is computed as 102 percent and it is 110 and 93 percent for males and females respectively (Fig. 4.2, Primary). Figure 4.2: GER by Gender and Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 On the provincial front where four provinces and four regions are decided for reporting in PES-2017-18 there is lot of variation in the GER with the lowest GER of 63 percent observed in Balochistan and the highest of 159 percent in ICT. More than hundred percent GER’s are observed for Punjab (110%) and KP (114%). Similar large scale variation is also observed for males and females. The lowest GER for males 74 percent is observed again in Balochistan with the highest 157 percent in ICT. For females the lowest 51 percent is observed for Balochistan and highest 162 percent for ICT (Fig. 4.2, Primary). Apart from ICT whose figures are highest both for males and females in the other provinces KP leads the way in terms of higher GER’s for males (129%) followed by Punjab, Sindh and AJK where male GER’s are 112, 103 and 101 percent respectively. Female GER for Punjab is observed at 108 percent followed by KP where it is 98 percent (Fig. 4.2, Primary). Lower GER’s are observed for females in Balochistan (51%), FATA (54%) and Sindh (70%), as compared to other provinces/regions. For males GER’s are also comparatively lower in Balochistan (74%), GB (83%) and FATA (97%) as compared to ICT, Punjab, Sindh and KP. GPI is defined as GER for females divided by GER for males. This index is used to indicate the level of access to education that females have, compared to the level of access that males have. For example, a GPI of more than one indicates that, in proportion to the appropriate school-age population, there are more females than males in the school system. The GPI is highest (1.03) in ICT and the lowest (0.55) in FATA. It is higher in Punjab and GB where it is observed to be 0.96 which is even higher than the national average (0.85). Sindh and Balochistan observed a GPI of 0.68 and 0.69 respectively. The lower GPI index values in Sindh (0.68), Balochistan (0.69), FATA (0.55) and KP (0.76) show that parents here seem to be more conservative with respect to female population (Table 7.6, Primary). Enrolment in the middle school education is 7.362 million with 4.089 (56%) million males and 3.273 (44%) million females during the year. This enrolment is up by 12.52 percent over the previous year. Based on official population of middle level a GER of 57 percent is computed for the country which is 61 percent for males and 53 percent for females. ICT observed the highest GER of 114 percent while FATA had the lowest GER of 27 percent. Punjab (65%), KP (68%) and AJK (60%) has GER’s of more than 60 percent. GER’s for other strata are below 50 percent. A similar pattern of GER ratios is observed for male and female enrolment in the provinces. It is noticed that male GER is always higher than the female GER’s indicating that relative to the appropriate school going age population, there are more male students than female students (Fig. 4.2, Middle). At national level a GPI of 0.87 is observed at middle level. GPI of Punjab (1.00), AJK (0.93), GB (0.90) and ICT (1.04) is reasonably high while for other provinces it is below 0.76 except FATA where it is as low as 0.22 (Table 7.6, Middle). Enrolment in the high level education is 3.861 million with 2.169 (56%) million males and 1.692 (44%) million females. On the basis of gross enrolment a GER of 46 percent is observed for high school education level with corresponding figures for males and females of 50 and 42 percent respectively showing a gender disparity of about 7 percent in favour of males. This disparity is more serious in the provincial GER figures where it is higher than 20 percent for KP and FATA. In Balochistan and Sindh it is 14 and 10 percent respectively. This disparity is minimal in Punjab, AJK, and GB where it is lower than three percent. There is no disparity observed in ICT with GER’s of 104 percent for males and females (Fig. 4.2, High). Enrolment in the higher secondary education including TVET is 2.121 million with 1.208 million (57%) males and 0.913 million (43%) females. An overall GER of 26 percent for this level with 29 and 23 percent for males and females observed respectively. Across the provinces GER ranged from 20 percent in Balochistan to 84 percent in ICT. An overall GPI of 0.81 is observed for the country at combined TVET and higher secondary level which ranges from 0.30 in FATA to 1.32 for ICT. Punjab, GB and ICT had more than one GPI while Sindh, KP and Balochistan observed more than 0.60 while it is 0.55 in AJK. In GB and Punjab a major shift in ranks is observed from rank eight to four and from rank six to three in favour of female enrolment while in FATA and Sindh it is reversed (Fig. 4.2, Higher Secondary). In order to get a complete picture of enrolment from primary to higher secondary level education (Classes 1-12) the data is combined. A total of 36.276 million admissions were granted in the country during the academic session 2017-18 with 20.305 million (56%) male and 15.971 million (44%) female students. At the national level GER of 70 percent was observed with gender distinction of 75 and 64 percent for males and females respectively. In the provinces/regions the highest GER was observed for ICT (127%) while it was lowest in Balochistan (42%). Gender-wise lowest was observed for males in Balochistan (50%) and for females in FATA (29%). ICT observed higher GER’s for both sexes with 124 and 131 percent for males and females respectively. The disparity in GER for gender was found the highest (35%) in FATA followed by KP (27%), Sindh (20%), Balochistan (17%) and AJK (7%). It was only two to three percent in Punjab, GB and ICT. It seems that there is need to boost up females admissions in Sindh, KP, Balochistan and FATA by campaigning for female education through electronic and print media in order to minimize the gap in male and female enrolment (Fig. 4.2, Primary to Higher Secondary). GPI at national level for primary to higher secondary was observed at 0.85 with minor fluctuations in the provinces/regions. It was the highest in ICT (1.06) and the lowest in FATA (0.45). 4.1.3 Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratio (ANER) In Pakistan education system with respect to age of the students is divided into four age groups from Primary to Higher Secondary School. These are: Primary Schools (Grade I-V) Age \\(05-09^{+}\\) Years Middle Schools (Grade VI-VIII) Age \\(10-12^{+}\\) Years Secondary Schools (Grade IX-X) Age \\(13-14^{+}\\) Years Higher Secondary Schools/Inter Colleges (Grade XI-XII) Age \\(15-16^{+}\\) Years However in normal practice the enrolment is allowed to students in these categories even if they do not strictly follow the limits of the age groups. Therefore a survey was conducted by a team of AEPAM under NEMIS to collect age specific data in sampled schools all over the country to provide basis for adjustment. The ANER’s discussed below are thus computed using the age specific percentages reported by NEMIS survey. Adjusted Net Enrolment in primary education was 16.534 million with 9.277 million (56%) males and 7.257 million (44%) females. The national ANER at primary level was reduced to 73 percent as against 102 percent GER for the year 2017-18. This was down by three percent over the previous year. Consequently ratios of ANER for males (79%) and females (67%) were computed as against GER’s of 110 and 93 percent for males and females respectively. There is no shift in ranks for GER and ANER except for AJK and FATA where ranks of 6 and 7 were exchanged to 7 and 6 respectively. It may also be noticed that higher percentages of adjustment were observed for Punjab and ICT (34, 62 percent) while it was lowest for FATA (12%) (Fig. 4.3, Primary). GPI of ANER at primary level was computed as 0.84 with the lowest of 0.57 for FATA showing gender disparity and the highest 1.01 for ICT showing gender parity. Adjusted net enrolment in middle education was 9.270 million with 5.165 million (56%) males and 4.105 million (44%) females. Adjusted net enrolment ratio (ANER) of 72 percent was observed for the country in the Middle level. This ratio was 77 percent for males and 66 percent for females showing about 11 percent more enrolment for males. This shows that about 15 percent students in this level were either below or above the officially declared age group of middle level education and for males and females this disparity was 16 and 6 percent respectively (Fig. 4.3, Middle). Figure 4.3: ANER by Gender and Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 ANER for middle level education was up from 57 percent GER to 72 percent. ANER was about 15 percent upwardly adjusted at middle level school education for under age and over age students admitted at this level. The highest adjustment was required in Punjab where it was 20 percent while the lower differences were observed in Balochistan and FATA where it was seven to nine percent which shows that admissions are strictly done in the officially declared age groups for the students in the province/region. GPI indices also showed minor adjustments from GER to ANER. For Pakistan ANER, GPI was 0.86 as compared to GER, GPI of 0.87. GPI of ANER was adjusted downward for Punjab and Sindh while it was adjusted upward for other strata but remained same for ICT. Adjusted net enrolment at high level was 4.997 million with 2.787 million (56%) males and 2.210 million (44%) females. ANER of 60 percent was observed for the country at secondary level. This ratio was 64 percent for males and 55 percent for females showing about nine percent more enrolment for males at national level. This shows that about 14 percent students in this level were either below or above the officially declared age group of secondary level education and for males and females this disparity was 14 and 13 percent respectively. The GPI for this level was observed as 0.86 which is better by two percentage points after adjustment. In the gender parity index some minor rank shuffling as well as index adjustment was observed across the provinces which does not seem to be critical. Punjab and ICT showed gender parity while in all other provinces/regions there was gender disparity of medium to high level, with FATA showing a very low GPI value of 0.22 (Fig. 4.3, High). Adjusted net enrolment at higher secondary level including TVET was 3.324 million with 1.894 million (57%) males and 1.430 million (43%) females. ANER for the higher secondary level education and TVET combined followed similar pattern as observed in middle and secondary level school education and it was up from 27 percent GER to 41 percent ANER with a 14 percent increase due to adjustment factor. Higher percentages of more than 14 percent were acquired for Punjab, KP and ICT while it were eight percent for Sindh and AJK, and two, three and four percent for GB, FATA and Balochistan. GPI of GER as well as ANER was observed as 0.81. GPI indices across the provinces for this education level observed changes in GB and ICT where these figures were greater than one showing parity in favour females, while for other provinces GPI values were from a low value of 0.30 to a high of 0.93 for FATA and Punjab respectively. Adjusted net enrolment (Class 1-12) was 34.125 million out of which 19.123 million (56%) were males and 15.002 million (44%) females. ANER at national level (primary to higher secondary) was lowered from GER by four percent and it stood at 66 percent after adjustment for official age (Age \\(05-16^{+}\\)). Maximum adjustment was needed in ICT where it was reduced by eight percent with only one and three percent adjustment required in FATA and Sindh. All other provinces/regions had four percent reduction from GER to ANER (Fig. 4.3). GPI of 0.85 was observed for ANER at the national level and it varied from a low of 0.46 in FATA to a high of 1.03 for ICT. For ANER the GPI index remained the same for all the provinces/regions with one percent reduction in AJK, FATA, and GB. GPI for ICT was reduced to 1.03 from 1.06 showing parity in favour of females. 4.1.4 Out of School Children NEMIS gives a complete picture of net enrolment and out-of-school children for all provinces and federating units in both the public sector (formal and non-formal) and private sector. The current population census was conducted in 2017, however, age-wise population figures are not yet published. As a result, all demographic calculations for subsequent years must use population projections based on the 1998 census. For the purpose of this report, projections of National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS) based on 1998 population census for the year 2017 have been used. For the enrolment, adjusted net enrolment figures have been taken. According to NIPS projections, there are currently 51.933 million children in Pakistan between the ages of 5 and 16 years. Among this group, only 34.125 million (66%) children are attending schools from primary upto higher secondary in both public and private sectors, leaving 17.808 million children (34%) out of school. This is a significant reduction (22%) over the previous year, when there were 22.844 million OOSC. There are currently 6.039 million children of primary-school age out of school. At the middle, high and higher secondary level, the out of school children are 3.665 million, 3.327 million and 4.755 million respectively (Fig. 4.4). If we observe gender-wise out of school children more females are out of school than males. In Primary to Higher Secondary Level, 40 percent of population of female children are out of school as compared to 29 percent of the male population. Out of total OOSC from primary to higher secondary there are 44 percent males and 56 percent females. Figure 4.4: Number of In School and Out of School Children by Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 Out of school children is a big issue which challenges the government about their responsibility to provide compulsory basic education to each and every child in the country (age \\(05-16^{+}\\) years) which is mandatory under the constitution. There are alarming figures that show that this basic right is not fulfilled for every child of the country. Distribution of OOSC by gender and eduction level is given in Fig. 4.5. A total of 6.039 million children (34%) are estimated to be out of schools in the primary age group (\\(05-09^{+}\\) years) of which 2.437 (40 percent) are males and 3.601 (60%) are females. This is almost 26.75 percent of the total population of this age group meaning that every one out of four children in this age group is out of school due to one reason or other. In KP, FATA, Sindh much more females are OOSC as compared to males. In Punjab and GB the difference is quite small. In ICT more males are OOSC as compared to females. There was an increase of 19.32 percent in OOSC at primary level of education in Pakistan over the previous year. Except from ICT and KP where there is decrease in OOSC over the previous year, all the other provinces observed an increase in the number of OOSC in the primary education. The percentage of OOSC across the provinces varied from (19, 54) in FATA to (33, 37) in GB for males and females respectively. In Punjab and AJK it is (22, 25) while in Balochistan and Sindh percentages of (45, 63) and (23, 47) are observed for males and females respectively (Fig. 4.6). OOSC in the middle level school education group also had 3.665 million children with 1.553 (42%) and 2.111 (58%) million males and females respectively. This is 28.33 percent of the total population at this age level showing even worse situation than observed at primary level. This number shows a reduction of 43.74 percent at this level of schooling over the previous year which is a good news. This reduction was observed for all provinces with varying percentages. OOSC in the high school education group showed 3.327 million children with 1.539 (46.25%) males and 1.788 (53.75%) females. This is 39.97 percent of total population of this age group who are OOSC. This number shows a reduction of 33.85 percent at this level of schooling. This reduction was observed for all provinces with varying percentages. Figure 4.5: Distribution of OOSC by Gender and Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 OOSC in the higher secondary level and TVET institutions combined showed 4.777 million children with 2.310 million (48%) males and 2.467 million (52%) females. Since there are a total of 8.101 million children in this age group which shows that 59 percent of them are not going to school. However compared with the previous year there is a reduction of 25 percent OOSC at this level of schooling and technical/skill development education. This reduction was observed for all provinces with varying percentages. Figure 4.6: Percentage distribution of OOSC by Gender and Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 For all classes in the age group (\\(05-16^{+}\\) years) there were 17.808 million OOSC of which 7.840 million (44%) were males and 9.968 million (56%) were females showing about 12 percent more females OOSC as compared to males. This shows that about 33.86 percent OOSC which means that one out of every three child does not attend school during the school going age (\\(05-16^{+}\\) years). Despite Government efforts the situation still needs much attention from the education departments to work for reducing the number of OOSC in females. This gap between male and female has widened over the previous year when it was about seven percent. There is need to make this gap closer by providing incentives for female education. It may be appropriate to describe that over the previous four academic years 2013-17 the OOSC figures remained almost stagnant 24.816, 24.024, 22.634 and 22.844 million showing (-3, -6 and 1) percent change over the corresponding previous year. In 2017-18 a decrease of 22.14 percent was observed when the OOSC figure dropped to 17.808 million children from 2016-17. The percentage distribution of OOSC by gender, education level and provinces/regions of Pakistan is given in Fig. 4.6. It is observed that at the national level from primary to higher secondary level there is a gap of about 11 percent showing more females (40%) are OOSC as compared to males (29%). This gap is quite small in Punjab, GB, AJK and ICT, while it is quite large in FATA, KP, Sindh, and Balochistan. Similar pattern with varying percentages is also visible at different stages of education. Major reason for this disparity is due to the cultural barriers in the society which can only be removed through better awareness through media and other means of communication and concerted efforts by the provincial/regional governments. 4.1.5 Effective Transition Rate 4.1.5.1 Effective Transition Rate (ETR) between Primary to Middle Level An ETR of 83 percent was observed for Pakistan for Primary to Middle which was lower by about one percent over the previous academic year (Table 5.2). Gender parity was almost one showing equal transition for males and females from primary to middle education. Effective Transition rate for females was lower in Sindh (67%) and FATA (63%) and higher in Punjab (87%) and GB (87%). For males ETR was almost hundred percent for FATA (100%) and ICT (98%) while it was above 80 percent for all other provinces/regions except Sindh where it was 73 percent. GPI for ETR from primary to middle was almost one at National level as well as for KP and Balochistan. It was a bit more than one in Punjab (1.02), GB (1.04) and ICT (1.02) showing gender parity and the lowest (0.63) in FATA showing gender disparity (Fig. 4.7). Figure 4.7: ETR by Gender and Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 4.1.5.2 Effective Transition Rate (ETR) from Middle to Secondary Level An ETR of 93 percent was observed at National level which was higher by two percent from the previous year (Table 5.2). It was six percent higher for males (96%) as compare to females (90%). ETR for males and females in different proviences/regions show gender disparities. It was mostly higher for males as compared to females except for GB where it was 83% for males and 1% higher for females. In ICT, ETR was 100% for both males and females (Fig. 4.7). GPI of one was observed for GB (1.01) and ICT (1.00) showing gender parity of ETR while for all other Provinces/Regions GPI’s for ETR were observed from 0.93 to 0.97 except for GB where it was 0.73. 4.2 Equity in Education 4.2.1 Gender Parity Index (GPI) for Gross Enrolment Ratios GPI’s for different stages of school education for Pakistan and Provinces/Regions are portrayed in Fig. 4.8. The gender differences in gross enrolment ratio in primary level of education shows a GPI of 0.85 for Pakistan. For ICT a GPI of 1.03 is observed while for Punjab (0.96), AJK (0.91), and GB (0.96) which signifies fairly equal proportions of males and females. Sindh (0.68), KP (0.76), Balochistan (0.69) and FATA (0.55) show comparatively low values of GPI for GER in primary education which is due to the socio-cultural constraints prevailing in these societies. Figure 4.8: General Parity Index of Gross Enrolment Ratio by Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 Gender parity in favour of females for GER were observed for Punjab, ICT, and GB, for all other provinces/regions the value was less than one. More variability in the GPI’s were found at higher secondary level. FATA had the lowest GPI’s for all levels of education. 4.2.2 Gender Parity Index (GPI) for Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratios GPI’s based on ANER for different levels of education and provinces/regions are portrayed in Fig. 4.9. It is again observed that at all levels FATA had the lowest GPI. Only ICT has GPI values of more than one showing gender parity in favour of females while for Punjab the values were quite close to one showing parity. Parities were below 0.80 for KP, Sindh, and Balochistan and above this value for AJK, and GB. Figure 4.9: General Parity Index of Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratio by Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 GPI for Enrolment Ratios in middle, secondary and higher secondary level of education show a similar pattern as observed in primary education but the values of FATA is further reduced to more than half of those observed at primary level. 4.3 Quality in Education 4.3.1 Survival Rate (SR) to Grade V, VIII and X Survival Rate also called Retention Rate, is the proportion of a cohort of pupils who reached Grade-V expressed as a percentage of pupils enrolled in the first grade of a given cycle in a given school year. A Survival Rate approaching 100 percent indicates a high level of retention and low dropout incidence. Survival Rate may vary from grade to grade, giving indications of grades with relatively more or less dropouts. The distinction between survival rate with and without repetition is necessary to compare the extent of wastage due to dropout and repetition. Survival rates reported here are based on without repetition. An overall survival rate of 63 percent to Grade-V in primary education was observed which was 67 and 59 percent for males and females respectively. In the provinces it was lower for Sindh (57%) and higher in Punjab (67%). In the regions a lowest value of 42 percent was observed for FATA with gender discrepancy of 56 and 21 percent for males and females respectively. In AJK and GB it was more than 70 percent while in ICT it was observed to be hundred percent for both sexes. The national GPI of survival to Grade-V was observed at 0.87 with highest in Punjab (1.04) favouring female students while it was lowest in FATA (0.38) in favour of males. Figure 4.10: Survival Rate by Gender for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 Class I-VIII survival rate for male and female at national level was observed as 48 and 43 respectively. Minimum was observed at 10 percent for females in FATA while maximum was observed for 100 percent for both males and females in ICT. The survival rate was reduced further to 39 and 34 percent for males and females at Class-X showing 28 and 25 percent reduction from Primary to Secondary level. In the Provinces/Regions only Punjab has better survival percentages for females (68, 53, and 43) as compared to (66, 48, and 39) for males for V, VIII and X grades respectively (Fig. 4.10). 4.3.2 Pupil Teacher, Pupil School, and Teacher School Ratios PTR, PSR, and TSR are one of the most common indicators used in educational planning. A low number of pupils per teacher indicate pupils will have a better chance of contact with the teachers and hence an improved teaching-learning process. The PTR should normally be compared to the established national norms on the number of pupils per teacher for each level or type of education. A high pupil-teacher ratio suggests that each teacher has to deal with a large number of pupils and that, conversely, pupils receive less attention from the teacher. This affects quality of learning. The ratio of students to teaching staff is also an important indicator of the resources devoted to education by the government. Pupil teacher ratio by education level and public/private sector for Provinces/Regions is given in Fig. 4.11. It portrays that generally PTR are on the lower side at all levels in the private sector. PTR in Public sector educational institutions is almost double than that in the private sector at the primary level which is a clear indicator of better availability of teachers to students at the basic level of education. This disparity is even more acute in Punjab and KP as compared to other Provinces/Regions. In Punjab similar situation persist at higher levels of education. Figure 4.11: Pupil Teacher Ratio by Education level and Sector for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 Figure 4.12: Pupil Teacher, Pupil School and Teacher School Ratios by Sector for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 A comparison of Pupil Teacher, Pupil School and Teacher School Ratios by sector and Provinces/Regions for 2017-18 is given in Fig. 4.12. At national level the Pupil Teacher ratio was 29:18 for public and private sector. This varied from as low as 17 in AJK to as high as 36 in FATA for public sector. The corresponding numbers for private sector were 16 to 33 for Punjab, ICT, GB and FATA. Pupil School ratio at national level was 158 and 212 for public and private sectors respectively. This varied from as low as 67 in Balochistan to as high as 496 in ICT for public sector schools. The corresponding numbers for private sector were 178 in Punjab to 365 in FATA. The Teacher School Ratio at the national level was 5 to 12. It was always smaller for public sector school as compared to private sector schools with the exception of ICT with 20 to 13 for public versus private schools. 4.3.3 Pupil Classroom Ratio (PCR) PCR is an important indicator to measure the quality of education at a particular level of education. A low pupil classroom ratio is often perceived good. This means as enough classrooms are available and less number of students in a classroom which facilitates teachers to focus more on the needs of individual students, thus reducing the amount of class time they spend dealing with disruptions. Figure 4.13: Pupil Classroom Ratio by Education level and Sector for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 PCR’s for educational levels and provinces/regions are given in Fig. 4.13. It shows that class sizes increase from primary (41) to higher secondary level (51). at national level. There is lot of variability in the provinces/regions. 4.3.4 Availability of Electricity In the summer season, non-availability of electricity affects the performance of teachers as well as students, especially in the hot areas. The performance of schools having computer and science labs are also severely affected by the non-availability of electricity. Fig. 4.14 presents the status of availability of electricity in schools of Pakistan. At national level the availability of electricity in primary, middle, high, and higher secondary schools is 68, 82, 93, and 97 percent respectively. The situation is pathetic in primary and middle schools of Balochistan, AJK, FATA, and GB. 4.3.5 Availability of Drinking Water Water is basic necessity of life. Availability of clean drinking water is an essential need of all population groups, especially young children attending school. Fig. 4.15 portrays the availability of drinking water by education level for provinces / regions. Here again situation in primary and middle schools needs major improvement in Balochistan, AJK, FATA, GB, and Sindh. Figure 4.14: Availability of Electricity by Education level for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 Figure 4.15: Availability of Drinking Water by Education level for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 4.3.6 Availability of Toilets for Students This is another essential facility which may become critical in female schools. It has been observed that even when this facility is reported to be available, there are many instances where the facility is un-usable due to poor maintenance, and practically the schools are without this facility. The percentage of availability are below percent in Balochistan, AJK, FATA, and GB primary schools while in Punjab and ICT it was hundred percent for all levels (Fig. 4.16). Figure 4.16: Availability of Toilets by Education level for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18 4.3.7 Availability of Boundary Wall The availability of boundary wall is gaining increased importance due to law and order situation. This becomes more critical in case of female education institutions where a boundary wall is a must. This facility was much below the national average for primary and middle level for Sindh, Balochistan, AJK, FATA, and GB. Punjab, KP, and ICT has better position for all levels (Fig. 4.17).

Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy. EFA Development Index (EDI): Composite index aimed at measuring overall progress towards EFA. At present, the EDI incorporates four of the most easily quantifiable EFA goals – universal primary education as measured by the primary adjusted net enrolment ratio; adult literacy as measured by the adult literacy rate; gender parity as measured by the gender-specific EFA index; and quality of education as measured by the survival rate to grade 5. Its value is the arithmetic mean of the observed values of these four indicators. Enrolment: Number of pupils or students enrolled at a given level of education, regardless of age. Enrolment by Stage: Enrolment by Stage defined as those students who are enrolled in one particular section of the school.

Higher realm of teaching, it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as tertiary education) and the graduate (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as quaternary education or graduate school). Higher education differs from other forms of post‐secondary education such as vocational education. However, most professional education is included within higher education, and many postgraduate qualifications are strongly vocationally or professionally oriented, for example in disciplines such as law and medicine. International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED): Classification system designed to serve as an instrument for assembling, compiling and presenting comparable indicators and statistics of education both within countries and internationally. The system, introduced in 1976, was revised in 1997 and 2011. Literacy: According to UNESCO’s 1958 definition, the term refers to the ability of an individual to read and write with understanding a simple short statement related to his/her everyday life. The concept of literacy has since evolved to embrace several skill domains, each conceived on a scale of different mastery levels and serving different purposes.

New Entrants: Pupils entering a given level of education for the first time; the difference between enrolment and repeaters in the first grade of the level. Non‐Formal Education: Learning activities typically organized outside the formal education system. The term is generally contrasted with formal and informal education. In different contexts, non‐formal education covers educational activities aimed at imparting adult literacy, basic education for out‐of‐school children and youth, life skills, work skills and general culture. Out-of-School Adolescents: Those of lower secondary school age who are not enrolled in either primary or secondary school. Out-of-School Children (OOSC): Children in the official primary school age range who are not enrolled in either primary or secondary school. Pre‐Primary Education(ISCED level 0): Programs at the initial stage of organized instruction, primarily designed to introduce very young children, aged at least 3 years, to a school-type environment and provide a bridge between home and school. Variously referred to as infant education, nursery education, pre-school education, kindergarten or early childhood education, such programs are the more formal component of ECCE. Upon completion of these programs, children continue their education at ISCED 1 (primary education). Primary Cohort Completion Rate: Proxy measure of primary school completion. It focuses on children who have access to school, measuring how many successfully complete it. The primary cohort completion rate is the product of the survival rate to the last grade and the percentage of those in the last grade who successfully graduate.

Public Expenditure on Education: Total current and capital expenditure on education by local, regional and national governments, including municipalities. Household contributions are excluded. The term covers public expenditure for both public and private institutions. Pupil: A child enrolled in pre‐primary or primary education. Youth and adults enrolled at more advanced levels are often referred to as students. Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR): Average number of pupils per teacher at a specific level of education. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): An exchange rate adjustment that accounts for price differences between countries, allowing international comparisons of real output and income.

School Age Population: Population of the age group officially corresponding to a given level of education, whether enrolled in school or not. School Life Expectancy (SLE): Number of years a child of school entrance age is expected to spend in school or university, including years spent on repetition. It is the sum of the age-specific enrolment ratios for primary, secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary education. A school life expectancy can be calculated for each level of education, including pre-primary education. Secondary Education: It is a period of education which, in most contemporary educational systems of the world, follows directly after primary education, and which may be followed by tertiary, “post‐secondary”, or “higher” education (e.g., university). Secondary Education (ISCED levels 2 and 3): Program made up of two stages: lower and upper secondary. Lower secondary education (ISCED 2) is generally designed to continue the basic programs of the primary level but the teaching is typically more subject- focused, requiring more specialized teachers for each subject area. The end of this level often coincides with the end of compulsory education. In upper secondary education (ISCED 3), the final stage of secondary education in most countries, instruction is often organized even more along subject lines and teachers typically need a higher or more subject-specific qualification than at ISCED level 2. Survival Rate by Grade: Percentage of a cohort of students who are enrolled in the first grade of an education cycle in a given school year and are expected to reach a specified grade, regardless of repetition. Teachers or Teaching Staff: Number of persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualification.

Tertiary education is commonly higher education which prepares students for a quaternary education. Tertiary or Higher Education (ISCED levels 5 and 6): Programs with an educational content more advanced than what is offered at ISCED levels 3 and 4. The first stage of tertiary education, ISCED level 5, includes level 5A, composed of largely theoretically based programs intended to provide sufficient qualifications for gaining entry to advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements; and level 5B, where programs are generally more practical, technical and/or occupationally specific. The second stage of tertiary education, ISCED level 6, comprises programs devoted to advanced study and original research, and leading to the award of an advanced research qualification. Trained Teacher: Teacher who has received the minimum organized teacher training (pre-service or in-service) normally required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country. Transition Rate to Secondary Education: New entrants to the first grade of secondary education in a given year, expressed as a percentage of the number of pupils enrolled in the final grade of middle education in the previous year.
