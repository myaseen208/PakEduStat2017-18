<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Education Statistics: An Overview</h1>
<p>Education plays a pivotal role in socio-economic development of a
nation. Education not only helps in nurturing and personality development
of children but it also prepares them for their future roles as responsible
and productive citizens of the country. After insertion of Article
25-A in the Constitution of Pakistan under the
18th Constitutional Amendment, free education has become a fundamental
and legal right and provision of free and compulsory education to
all children of age group 5-16 years has become the responsibility
of the state. Education has been recognized and guaranteed as a basic
human right by United Nations under Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (1948). Government
of Pakistan is fully cognizant about the importance of education,
therefore each successive government has invested in education for
numerous reasons i.e. human capital development, economic growth,
human rights, promotion of good citizenship and to strengthen equal
opportunity to its populace. In addition acquiring education is linked
to poverty reduction as it imparts knowledge and skills to enhance
the productivity of labour force. Therefore, provision and financing
of education has remained the primary responsibility of the state
of Pakistan. Historically, in Pakistan, commitment of the state to
social service delivery, education in particular, has often competed
with heavy debt repayments, large and ever-expanding defense budget
needs and unproductive expenditures on running oversized public sector
enterprises.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s schooling system consists of three main school types namely
public sector schools, private sector schools and Deeni Madaris. These
are further divided as public and private mainly due to curriculum
and examination systems used in the schools and the language of instructions
used by teachers.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2.1: Percentage distribution of Institutions, Enrolment and Teachers by Sector 2017-18
</p>
</div>
<p>The education system of Pakistan is comprised of 305,763 institutions
accommodating 51,835,089 students and 2,073,433 teachers. The system
is composed of 189,748 (62%) public institutions and
116,015 (38%) private institutions,
which also include 31,115 Deeni Madaris.</p>
<p>The public sector is serving 29.24 million (56%) students to complete
their education while the remaining 22.70 million (44%) are enrolled
in the private sector of education. About 38 percent private educational
institutions are facilitating 44 percent of students showing a slightly
higher per-institution enrolment ratio in
the private sector compared to the public sector. In the last decade
due to encouragement of the government there is a gradual growth of
opening of educational institutions in the private sector. In terms
of teaching staff, 46 percent of teachers work in the public sector
institutions, compared to 54 percent in the private sector (including
8% teachers serving in the Deeni Madaris) (Fig. <a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Dist-IET-2017-18">2.1</a>).</p>
<p>Education is seen as a major force for eliminating gender inequities
within the society, though addressing inequalities within the education
system itself is a tremendous challenge. Ratio of male teachers is
higher in public sector whereas ratio of female teachers is higher
in private sector. Gender composition of
the enrolled students is 56 percent males compared to 44 percent female

<p>Percentage distribution of institutions, enrolment and number of teachers
upto the degree colleges for provinces/regions by sector is given
in the Fig. <a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Dist-IET-by-Sector-Regs">2.3</a>. At the national
level the percentage difference in the public and private sectors
is 38, 26 and 4 percent for institutions, enrolment &amp; teachers respectively.
This disparity is maximum (86%) in Balochistan
and GB for institutional divide in favour of public sector 64 and
58 percent for FATA and Balochistan for enrolment divide and 68 and
60 percent again for FATA and Balochistan for teacher divide. It may
also be noticed that in ICT private sector has sizeable edge in favour
of all three determinants. In GB there were two percent more teachers
in private sector. In AJK there were more percentage of institutions,
enrolment and teachers in the private sector.</p>
<p>Percentage distribution of enrolment
and teachers for provinces/regions by gender is given in the Fig.
<a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Dist-IET-by-Gender-Regs">2.4</a>. It is observed that enrolment
percentages are higher by twelve percent for males as compared to
females at the national level. This difference is two percent for
ICT, about 20 percent in Sindh, KP and Balochistan and maximum of
38 percent in FATA. There are about 20 percent more female teachers
imparting education to students upto the degree colleges. It seems
that this domination is due to the private sector where comparatively
more female teachers are hired as compared to male teachers for lower
classes. In Punjab, Sindh, AJK, and ICT there are 40, 6, 6 and 52
percent more female teachers as compared to male teachers respectively.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Education Statistics by Categories of Institutions</h2>
<p>The educational institutions in the country are divided into following
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Primary</li>
<li>Primary</li>
<li>Middle</li>
<li>High</li>
<li>Higher Secondary</li>
<li>Inter-Colleges</li>
<li>Degree Colleges</li>
<li>Universities</li>
<li>Technical &amp; Vocational Institutions</li>
<li>Teacher Training Institutions</li>
<li>Non-Formal Basic Education</li>
<li>Education Foundations</li>
<li>Deeni Madaris</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections, present an overview of the country’s education
system in terms of these categories of educational institutions. These
broad categories will be further analyzed on the basis of sector,
gender and education level. From Pre-Primary to university level this
can be broadly categorized into three levels, namely</p>
<ul>
<li>School Education (Pre-Primary - Class 12)</li>
<li>College Education (Degree Colleges, Class 13-14)</li>
<li>University Education</li>
</ul>
<p>The formal education system comprises of
223,116 institutions out of which 137,460 (61%), 46,665 (21%), 31,392
(14%), 5,754 (3%) and 1,845 (1%) represent Primary (including pre-primary),
middle, high, higher secondary and degree colleges/universities respectively.
The percentage distribution of educational institutions upto higher
secondary/inter college level is shown in Fig. <a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Dist-Insti-Sector-Regs">2.5</a>
which gives public/private sector divide for the given categories
of education at national as well as provinces/regions level.</p>

<p>It is observed that at primary level 87 percent institutions are in
the public sector, while only 13 percent are in the private sector.
For the middle, high and higher secondary level private sector has
more institutions as compared to public sector. Provinces/Regions
portray similar picture at primary level except in ICT where there
are more primary schools in private sector. Disparities can be observed
at different stages which must be taken into account by the policy
planners for bringing correction in the institutional divide.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> School Education</h3>
<p>Separate pre-primary institutions don’t exist in the public sector
of Pakistan, however, admissions in pre-primary are given in public
sector schools. The total enrolment at pre-primary stage is 9.489
million. Public sector has an enrolment of 4.830 million (51%), whereas
the private sector has 4.659 million (49%).</p>
<p>There are a total of 137,079 primary schools in the country out of
these 119,202 (87%) are in the public sector, whereas, 17,877 (13%)
are in the private sector. The primary stage of education in Pakistan
enrols 18.664 million students. Out of which 12.065 million (65%)
are in public sector and 6.599 million (35%) are in private sector
(Fig. <a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Dist-Insti-Sector-Regs">2.5</a>).</p>
<p>Out of the total enrolment at primary stage, 10.424 million (56%)
are male and 8.239 million (44%) are females. In the provinces of
Sindh, KP and Balochistan and FATA region more than ninety percent
institutions at the primary level were in the public sector and less
than ten percent in the private sector. ICT has more than twice schools
at the primary level in the private sector as compared to the public

<p>Since there is no separate allocation of teachers to the pre-primary
level in the public sector, their number is not reported. Whereas
the private sector has separate teachers for pre-primary sector and
the reported number of teachers is 2,117.</p>
<p>At national level, there are 46,665 middle schools of which 16,550

<p>A pictorial comparison of percentage distribution of number of institutions,
enrolment and teachers by level of education is given in Fig <a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Pie-Chart">2.10</a>.</p>
<p>At primary level schooling there are 62 percent of institutions, with
67 percent of enrolment and having 28 percent of teachers of the entire
education system in Pakistan. The point of concern for policy makers
is the low percentage of teachers available for primary education
when minor children need more attention from their teachers.</p>
<p>The public sector portrays 78 percent institutions, with 63 percent
enrolment and 41 percent teachers at primary which is better than
the overall picture. However the private sector contributing with
26 percent institutions, and teachers 14 percent educating much higher
percentage of students (75%) at primary level. The governing bodies
of the private sector institutions need to take corrective measures
to improve the quality of education at the very basic tier of the
education system.</p>
<p>At middle level the institution, enrolment and teacher percentage
triplet is 21:15:26 which is more balanced as compared to the primary
level. The private sector triplet is (43:14:37) as compared to public

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Non-Formal Basic Education</h3>
<p>Non-Formal Basic Education (NFBE)
comprises of a number of departments like Basic Education Community
Schools (BECS), National Commission for Human Development (NCHD),
Punjab Literacy &amp; NFBE Department, Sindh Education and Literacy Department
(SELD), Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), Balochistan Literacy and
NFE Department and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs). This segment
has been a significant feature of policy debates around education
in many countries for three decades. It has drawn attention to the
importance and potential of education, learning and training that
takes place outside recognized educational institutions.</p>
<p>According to Pakistan Education Statistics Report 2016-17, 22.8 million
children (44%) between the ages of 5 and 16 were out of schools in
Pakistan, though the number has reduced to 17.8 million this year.
It is important to note that out of school children of 5-9 years are
only 22 percent whereas remaining cohort of 10-16 years of age constitutes
78 percent. This age cohort signifies a huge range of diversity and
complexity with reference to their education. Most of them have become
overage owing to missing early years of schooling or drop out from
schools before completing primary or elementary education cycle. Children
belonging to this particular age cohort have to face difficulty in
readmission in schools owing to formal school policy. Therefore, they
necessarily require a second chance to educate themselves and re-enter
the educational mainstream to complete basic education and continue
their education from sixth grade or through distance learning from
AIOU.</p>
<p>Under second chance education phenomenon NFBE provides options in
the form of an alternative education model that are flexible, fast
track and equivalent education. Such models are known as Accelerated
Education Programs (AEPs)/Accelerated Learning Programs (ALPs). These
model serve the learning needs of a specific group of out-of-school
children especially those who missed their early school years or dropped
out before completing primary or elementary education cycle.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The NFBE work under AEP/ALP model which is one teacher and one room,
where the space is generally provided by the community and is highly
inclusive in nature. It addresses diversity by including the excluded
especially refugees, IDPs and those with minor or moderate learning
difficulties through multi-grade, multi-age, and multi-language teaching
and learning approaches. Teachers’ professional qualification is low,
but their capacity is enhanced through extensive and enabling in-service
Continuous Professional Development (CDP) methods. Class timings are
flexible and are offered as per the availability of learners in condensed
and accelerated time frame. The primary model offers primary cycle
in 32-36 months while elementary model offers this cycle in 18-24
months including selected skill courses. The assessment and examination
is carried out through authorized assessment bodies for equivalence
and valid certificates, which ensure continuing education and mainstreaming.
This model is highly participative and involves community in all its
operations for sustainability and lasting impact. Considering the
current circumstances, this model is suitable for being in-expensive.
The cost per child per month ranges from Rs.300-500. Therefore, this
model can be adopted to address the issue of out-of-school children
with minimum financial inputs.</p>
<p>There are 35,059 institutions imparting non-formal basic education
in the country in the public sector. Students enrolled in NFBE are
1.425 million with 0.727 million (54%) and 0.699 million (46%) males
and females respectively. There are 33,990 serving teachers, out of
which 34 percent are male and 66 percent female teachers (Fig. <a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Dist-Teachers-2017-18-1">2.15</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Technical &amp; Vocational Education Training Institutions</h3>
<p>Technical and Vocational Education &amp; Training (TVET) is basically
the skill-development of workforce working in the different sectors
of economy of a country. It is also defined as marketable and economically
relevant education for people. Technical Education refers to post-secondary
courses of study and practical training aimed at preparation of technicians
to work as supervisory staff. Vocational Training, on the other hand,
refers to the lower-level education and training for the preparation
of skilled or semi-skilled workers in various trades, but it does
not enhance their level with respect to general education. There is
a fresh awareness among policy makers in developing countries and
the international community of the critical role that TVET can play
in national development. One of the most important features of TVET
is its orientation towards the world of work and the emphasis of the
curriculum on the acquisition of employable skills. TVET delivery
systems are therefore well placed to train the skilled and entrepreneurial
workforce that the country needs to create wealth and alleviate poverty.
TVET is important because TVET institutions can respond to the different
training needs of learners from different socio-economic and academic
backgrounds, and prepare them for gainful employment and sustainable
livelihoods. The youth, the poor and the vulnerable of society can
therefore directly benefit from TVET programs. In a developing country
like Pakistan, it is extremely important to realize that large number
of young people are outside the formal school system, requiring the
integration of non-formal learning methodologies and literacy programs
into national education system. To revitalize, modernize and harmonize
TVET in order to transform it into a mainstream activity for the youth
development and human capacity building in Pakistan the present Government
has included skills development as one of the priority areas in its
education policy.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, there are 3,740 technical and vocational institutions,
of which 1,627 (44%) are in public sector, whereas 2,113 (56%) are
in private sector (Fig. <a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Perc-Dist-ITND">2.12</a>). This is roughly
1.23 percent in the overall institutional scenario of the country.
It needs much more focus of the government as this is an era of skill
development which can contribute much more in the country’s economic
development.</p>

in the overall student enrolment at the national level which is quite
low percentage for skill development education. This area needs much
better focus of the government.</p>

institutions are serving 64 percent of total technical &amp; vocational
enrolment, while 56 percent private institutions are serving 36 percent
of the private sector enrolment in the country. The total male enrolment

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Education Foundations</h3>
<p>There are five Education Foundations working in the country in the
private sector. They are National Education Foundation (NEF), Punjab
Education Foundation (PEF), Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), KP Elementary
and Secondary Education Foundation (KPESEF) and Balochistan Education
Foundation (BEF). Under the umbrella of these Education Foundations
there are 12,516 institutions working for educating children for elementary
and secondary education. More than 60 percent of these institutions
are working in the Punjab province, while more than 16 percent each
are in Sindh and KP. Balochistan Education Foundation control five
percent of the educational foundation institutions which are limited
to female children only. NEF, BEF and SEF closed one, one and 91 institutions
this year while Punjab, and KPESEF increased 510 and 781 institutions
respectively.</p>
<p>There were 3.367 million enrolments during the year 2017-18 in these
Education Foundation institutions which increased by about 22 percent
over the previous year. The major share of this enrolment jump is
due to about 26 and 171 percent increase in Punjab and KP respectively.
The enrolment of female students in KPESEF was 64 percent as compared
to male students (34%). In Punjab and Sindh the enrolment percentage
was (55:45) and (59:41) for males and females respectively. Student-Teacher
ratio was 29:1 at the national level while it varied a lot with respect
to different foundations. It was 26:1 for NEF, 28:1 for PEF, 33:1
for SEF, 43:1 for KPESEF and 14:1 for BEF. There is need to further
strengthen these Education Foundations to address the problem of OOSC
and also encourage public-private partnership (Table 6.12).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Deeni Madaris</h3>
<p>Traditionally, Deeni Madaris are Islamic learning institutions, aimed
at producing Islamic scholars and leaders. Deeni Madaras provide free
religious education, boarding and lodging to their learners. For these
reasons, they are essentially schools for the poor. Their students
learn how to read, memorize and recite the Holy Qur’an properly. They
issue certificates of various levels which are also recognized by
the government. A Dar-Ul-Ulum usually having hundred of students is
their university level while a Maktab having about fifty students
is equivalent to a primary school. The graduating students are called
Haffiz-ul-Qur’an (those who memorize the Arabic text of the Qur’an)
or Qaris (those who can recite Qur’anic verses with proper Arabic
pronunciation). Ulema (Religious Scholars) are those who have advanced
theological training in religious studies. Present government is taking
lot of interest in revamping these institutions to bring them closer
to the mainstream education system by including contemporary subjects
like English, Urdu, Mathematics, and Science etc. in their curriculum
in addition to the routine religious teachings.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 31,115 Deeni Madaris working in Pakistan. All
of these religious institutions are working under the umbrella of
the private sector. The total enrolment in the Deeni Madaris is 4.099
million. More than 0.179 million teachers are serving in these Deeni
Madaras. The total male enrolment in Deeni Madaris is 2.362 million
(58%), whereas, the female enrolment is 1.737 million (42%) (Fig.
<a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Dist-Enrol-2017-18">2.11</a>). There are 140,950 (79%) male and
38,453 (21%) female teachers imparting religious education to the
students from primary to master’s level (Fig. <a href="education-statistics-an-overview.html#fig:Dist-Teachers-2017-18-1">2.15</a>).</p>
