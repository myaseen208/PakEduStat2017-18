<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Effectiveness of Education System</h1>
<p>In the path to economic development, education has become a central
element of the country’s growth strategies. To be effective in the
long run, improvements in education need to enable all children to
have access to quality education without discrimination, to stay in
the system until at least at the end of higher secondary education,
and to achieve the skills and knowledge they will need for effective
social and labour market integration.</p>
<p>Access, Equity and Quality of education are very important considerations
for analyzing the effectiveness of the education system. For each
of these important parameters, there are a number of indicators which
can determine the level of access, equity
and quality in education system.</p>
<div id="access-in-education" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Access in Education</h2>
<div id="gross-intake-rate-gir" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Gross Intake Rate (GIR)</h3>
<p>Gross Intake Rate (GIR) is defined as total
number of new entrants in the first grade of primary education, regardless
of age, expressed as a percentage of the population at the official
primary school-entrance age.</p>
<p>A high GIR indicates in general a high degree of access to primary
education. As this calculation includes all new entrants to the first
grade, including over-aged and under-aged children entering primary
school for the first time, the value of GIR can be more than 100 percent.</p>
<p>At the national level GIR for 2017-18 remained unchanged at 98 percent.
However GIR in the provinces/regions showed increase/decrease. It
showed increase in Punjab, AJK and ICT and decrease in all other provinces/regions.
GIR for males (105) was 13 percent higher than females (92). This
difference was high in KP (20%) and FATA (38%) than other provinces/regions
(Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:GIR-by-Gender">4.1</a>). It was the lowest in Punjab where
only one percent difference between male and female GIR was observed.</p>

<div id="gross-enrolment-ratio-ger" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)</h3>
<p>The GER is the most commonly used indicator to measure
coverage in the education system. GER is defined as the number of
students, regardless of age, enrolled in a specific school phase (e.g.
primary phase for class 1 to 5) as a percentage of the total appropriate
school-age population (e.g. age <span class="math inline">\(5-9^{+}\)</span> years old for the primary
phase). For example, a GER of more than 100 percent indicates that
there are more students in the formal schooling system than in the
appropriate school-age population (total potential population), which
is evidence of enrolment of under-aged and over-aged students owing
to early or late entry and grade repetition. It shows the overall
coverage of an education system in relation to the population eligible
for participation in the enrolment in schools. It is useful for those
who are interested in the overall participation rate of the school-age
population in a particular education level. It can be used for comparing

etc.</p>
<p>Gross enrolment in primary education is 22.931 million with 12.838
million (56%) males and 10.093 million (44%) females. In order to
compute GER population of official primary school age is required.
Since the Population Census 2017 official
figures are yet to be finalized so population projections
by NIPS 2005-25 were used for this purpose. According to these projections
the projected population figures at national level for age group (
<span class="math inline">\(5-9^{+}\)</span> years) were 22.572 million with 11.714 million (51.9%)
males and 10.858 million (49.1%) females. Resultantly GER for Pakistan
is computed as 102 percent and it is 110 and 93 percent for males
and females respectively (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:GER-by-Gender-Edu">4.2</a>, Primary).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>On the provincial front where four provinces and four regions are
decided for reporting in PES-2017-18 there is lot of variation in
the GER with the lowest GER of 63 percent observed in Balochistan
and the highest of 159 percent in ICT. More than hundred percent GER’s
are observed for Punjab (110%) and KP (114%). Similar large scale
variation is also observed for males and females. The lowest GER for
males 74 percent is observed again in Balochistan with the highest
157 percent in ICT. For females the lowest 51 percent is observed
for Balochistan and highest 162 percent for ICT (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:GER-by-Gender-Edu">4.2</a>,
Primary).</p>
<p>Apart from ICT whose figures are highest both for males and females
in the other provinces KP leads the way in terms of higher GER’s for
males (129%) followed by Punjab, Sindh and AJK where male GER’s are
112, 103 and 101 percent respectively. Female GER for Punjab is observed
at 108 percent followed by KP where it is 98 percent (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:GER-by-Gender-Edu">4.2</a>,
Primary).</p>
<p>Lower GER’s are observed for females in Balochistan (51%), FATA (54%)
and Sindh (70%), as compared to other provinces/regions. For males
GER’s are also comparatively lower in Balochistan (74%), GB (83%)
and FATA (97%) as compared to ICT, Punjab, Sindh and KP.</p>
<p>GPI is defined as GER for females divided by GER for males. This index
is used to indicate the level of access to education that females
have, compared to the level of access that males have. For example,
a GPI of more than one indicates that, in proportion to the appropriate
school-age population, there are more females than males in the school
system.</p>
<p>The GPI is highest (1.03) in ICT and the lowest (0.55)
in FATA. It is higher in Punjab and GB where it is observed to be
0.96 which is even higher than the national average (0.85). Sindh
and Balochistan observed a GPI of 0.68 and 0.69 respectively. The
lower GPI index values in Sindh (0.68), Balochistan (0.69), FATA (0.55)
and KP (0.76) show that parents here seem to be more conservative
with respect to female population (Table 7.6, Primary).</p>
<p>Enrolment in the middle school education is 7.362 million with 4.089
(56%) million males and 3.273 (44%) million females during the year.
This enrolment is up by 12.52 percent over the previous year. Based
on official population of middle level a GER of 57 percent is computed
for the country which is 61 percent for males and 53 percent for females.
ICT observed the highest GER of 114 percent while FATA had the lowest
GER of 27 percent. Punjab (65%), KP (68%) and AJK (60%) has GER’s
of more than 60 percent. GER’s for other strata are below 50 percent.
A similar pattern of GER ratios is observed for male and female enrolment
in the provinces. It is noticed that male GER is always higher than
the female GER’s indicating that relative to the appropriate school
going age population, there are more male students than female students
(Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:GER-by-Gender-Edu">4.2</a>, Middle).</p>
<p>At national level a GPI of 0.87 is observed at middle level. GPI of
Punjab (1.00), AJK (0.93), GB (0.90) and ICT (1.04) is reasonably
high while for other provinces it is below 0.76 except FATA where
it is as low as 0.22 (Table 7.6, Middle).</p>
<p>Enrolment in the high level education is 3.861 million with 2.169
(56%) million males and 1.692 (44%) million females. On the basis
of gross enrolment a GER of 46 percent is observed for high school
education level with corresponding figures for males and females of
50 and 42 percent respectively showing a gender disparity of about
7 percent in favour of males. This disparity is more serious in the
provincial GER figures where it is higher than 20 percent for KP and
FATA. In Balochistan and Sindh it is 14 and 10 percent respectively.
This disparity is minimal in Punjab, AJK, and GB where it is lower
than three percent. There is no disparity observed in ICT with GER’s
of 104 percent for males and females (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:GER-by-Gender-Edu">4.2</a>, High).</p>
<p>Enrolment in the higher secondary education including TVET is 2.121
million with 1.208 million (57%) males and 0.913 million (43%) females.
An overall GER of 26 percent for this level with 29 and 23 percent
for males and females observed respectively. Across the provinces
GER ranged from 20 percent in Balochistan to 84 percent in ICT. An
overall GPI of 0.81 is observed for the country at combined TVET and
higher secondary level which ranges from 0.30 in FATA to 1.32 for
ICT. Punjab, GB and ICT had more than one GPI while Sindh, KP and
Balochistan observed more than 0.60 while it is 0.55 in AJK. In GB
and Punjab a major shift in ranks is observed from rank eight to four
and from rank six to three in favour of female enrolment while in
FATA and Sindh it is reversed (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:GER-by-Gender-Edu">4.2</a>, Higher Secondary).</p>
<p>In order to get a complete picture of enrolment from primary to higher
secondary level education (Classes 1-12) the data is combined. A total
of 36.276 million admissions were granted in the country during the
academic session 2017-18 with 20.305 million (56%) male and 15.971
million (44%) female students. At the national level GER of 70 percent
was observed with gender distinction of 75 and 64 percent for males
and females respectively. In the provinces/regions the highest GER
was observed for ICT (127%) while it was lowest in Balochistan (42%).
Gender-wise lowest was observed for males in Balochistan (50%) and
for females in FATA (29%). ICT observed higher GER’s for both sexes
with 124 and 131 percent for males and females respectively. The disparity
in GER for gender was found the highest (35%) in FATA followed by
KP (27%), Sindh (20%), Balochistan (17%) and AJK (7%). It was
only two to three percent in Punjab, GB and ICT. It seems that there
is need to boost up females admissions in Sindh, KP, Balochistan and
FATA by campaigning for female education through electronic and print
media in order to minimize the gap in male and female enrolment (Fig.
<a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:GER-by-Gender-Edu">4.2</a>, Primary to Higher Secondary). GPI
at national level for primary to higher secondary was observed at
0.85 with minor fluctuations in the provinces/regions. It was the
highest in ICT (1.06) and the lowest in FATA (0.45).</p>

<div id="adjusted-net-enrolment-ratio-aner" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratio (ANER)</h3>
<p>In Pakistan education system with
respect to age of the students is divided into four age groups from
Primary to Higher Secondary School. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Primary Schools (Grade I-V) Age <span class="math inline">\(05-09^{+}\)</span> Years</p></li>
<li><p>Middle Schools (Grade VI-VIII) Age <span class="math inline">\(10-12^{+}\)</span> Years</p></li>
<li><p>Secondary Schools (Grade IX-X) Age <span class="math inline">\(13-14^{+}\)</span> Years</p></li>
<li><p>Higher Secondary Schools/Inter Colleges (Grade XI-XII) Age <span class="math inline">\(15-16^{+}\)</span> Years</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However in normal practice the enrolment is allowed to students in
these categories even if they do not strictly follow the limits of
the age groups. Therefore a survey was conducted by a team of AEPAM
under NEMIS to collect age specific data
in sampled schools all over the country to provide basis for adjustment.
The ANER’s discussed below are thus computed using the age specific
percentages reported by NEMIS survey.</p>
<p>Adjusted Net Enrolment in primary education
was 16.534 million with 9.277 million (56%) males and 7.257 million
(44%) females. The national ANER at primary level was
reduced to 73 percent as against 102 percent GER for the year 2017-18.
This was down by three percent over the previous year. Consequently
ratios of ANER for males (79%) and females (67%) were computed as
against GER’s of 110 and 93 percent for males and females respectively.
There is no shift in ranks for GER and ANER except for AJK and FATA
where ranks of 6 and 7 were exchanged to 7 and 6 respectively. It
may also be noticed that higher percentages of adjustment were observed
for Punjab and ICT (34, 62 percent) while it was lowest for FATA (12%)
(Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:ANER-by-Gender-Edu">4.3</a>, Primary). GPI of ANER at primary
level was computed as 0.84 with the lowest of 0.57 for FATA showing
gender disparity and the highest 1.01 for ICT showing gender parity.</p>
<p>Adjusted net enrolment in middle education
was 9.270 million with 5.165 million (56%) males and 4.105 million
(44%) females. Adjusted net enrolment ratio (ANER) of 72 percent
was observed for the country in the Middle level. This ratio was 77
percent for males and 66 percent for females showing about 11 percent
more enrolment for males. This shows that about 15 percent students
in this level were either below or above the officially declared age
group of middle level education and for males and females this disparity
was 16 and 6 percent respectively (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:ANER-by-Gender-Edu">4.3</a>, Middle).</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.3: ANER by Gender and Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18
</p>
</div>
<p>ANER for middle level education was up from 57 percent GER to 72 percent.
ANER was about 15 percent upwardly adjusted at middle level school
education for under age and over age students admitted at this level.
The highest adjustment was required in Punjab where it was 20 percent
while the lower differences were observed in Balochistan and FATA
where it was seven to nine percent which shows that admissions are
strictly done in the officially declared age groups for the students
in the province/region. GPI indices also showed minor adjustments
from GER to ANER. For Pakistan ANER, GPI was 0.86 as compared to GER,
GPI of 0.87. GPI of ANER was adjusted downward for Punjab and Sindh
while it was adjusted upward for other strata but remained same for
ICT.</p>
<p>Adjusted net enrolment at high level was 4.997 million with 2.787
million (56%) males and 2.210 million (44%) females. ANER of 60
percent was observed for the country at secondary level. This ratio
was 64 percent for males and 55 percent for females showing about
nine percent more enrolment for males at national level. This shows
that about 14 percent students in this level were either below or
above the officially declared age group of secondary level education
and for males and females this disparity was 14 and 13 percent respectively.
The GPI for this level was observed as 0.86 which is better by two
percentage points after adjustment. In the gender parity index some
minor rank shuffling as well as index adjustment was observed across
the provinces which does not seem to be critical. Punjab and ICT showed
gender parity while in all other provinces/regions there was gender
disparity of medium to high level, with FATA showing a very low GPI
value of 0.22 (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:ANER-by-Gender-Edu">4.3</a>, High).</p>
<p>Adjusted net enrolment at higher secondary level including TVET was
3.324 million with 1.894 million (57%) males and 1.430 million (43%)
females. ANER for the higher secondary level education and TVET combined
followed similar pattern as observed in middle and secondary level
school education and it was up from 27 percent GER to 41 percent ANER
with a 14 percent increase due to adjustment factor. Higher percentages
of more than 14 percent were acquired for Punjab, KP and ICT while
it were eight percent for Sindh and AJK, and two, three and four percent
for GB, FATA and Balochistan. GPI of GER as well as ANER was observed
as 0.81. GPI indices across the provinces for this education level
observed changes in GB and ICT where these figures were greater than
one showing parity in favour females, while for other provinces GPI
values were from a low value of 0.30 to a high of 0.93 for FATA and
Punjab respectively.</p>
<p>Adjusted net enrolment (Class 1-12) was 34.125 million out of which
19.123 million (56%) were males and 15.002 million (44%) females.
ANER at national level (primary to higher secondary) was lowered from
GER by four percent and it stood at 66 percent after adjustment for
official age (Age <span class="math inline">\(05-16^{+}\)</span>). Maximum adjustment was needed in
ICT where it was reduced by eight percent with only one and three
percent adjustment required in FATA and Sindh. All other provinces/regions
had four percent reduction from GER to ANER (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:ANER-by-Gender-Edu">4.3</a>).
GPI of 0.85 was observed for ANER at the national level and it varied
from a low of 0.46 in FATA to a high of 1.03 for ICT. For ANER the
GPI index remained the same for all the provinces/regions with one
percent reduction in AJK, FATA, and GB. GPI for ICT was reduced to
1.03 from 1.06 showing parity in favour of females.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> Out of School Children</h3>
<p>NEMIS gives a complete picture of net enrolment and out-of-school
children for all provinces and federating units in both
the public sector (formal and non-formal) and private sector.</p>
<p>The current population census was conducted in 2017, however, age-wise
population figures are not yet published. As a result, all demographic
calculations for subsequent years must use population projections
based on the 1998 census. For the purpose of this report, projections
of National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS) based
on 1998 population census for the year 2017 have been used. For the
enrolment, adjusted net enrolment figures have been taken. According
to NIPS projections, there are currently
51.933 million children in Pakistan between the ages of 5 and 16 years.
Among this group, only 34.125 million (66%) children are attending
schools from primary upto higher secondary in both public and private
sectors, leaving 17.808 million children (34%) out of school.
This is a significant reduction (22%) over the previous year, when
there were 22.844 million OOSC.</p>
<p>There are currently 6.039 million children of primary-school age out
of school. At the middle, high and higher secondary level, the out
of school children are 3.665 million, 3.327 million and 4.755 million
respectively (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:No-InSchool-OOSC">4.4</a>).</p>
<p>If we observe gender-wise out of school children more females are
out of school than males. In Primary to Higher Secondary Level, 40
percent of population of female children are out of school as compared
to 29 percent of the male population. Out of total OOSC
from primary to higher secondary there are 44 percent males and 56
percent females.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.4: Number of In School and Out of School Children by Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18
</p>
</div>
<p>Out of school children is a big issue which challenges the government
about their responsibility to provide compulsory basic education to
each and every child in the country (age <span class="math inline">\(05-16^{+}\)</span> years) which
is mandatory under the constitution. There are alarming figures that
show that this basic right is not fulfilled for every child of the
country. Distribution of OOSC by gender and eduction level is given
in Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:Dist-OOSC-Gender-Edu">4.5</a>. A total of 6.039 million
children (34%) are estimated to be out of schools in the primary
age group (<span class="math inline">\(05-09^{+}\)</span> years) of which 2.437 (40 percent) are males
and 3.601 (60%) are females. This is almost 26.75 percent of the
total population of this age group meaning that every one out of four
children in this age group is out of school due to one reason or other.
In KP, FATA, Sindh much more females are OOSC as compared to males.
In Punjab and GB the difference is quite small. In ICT more males
are OOSC as compared to females. There was an increase of 19.32 percent
in OOSC at primary level of education in Pakistan over the previous
year. Except from ICT and KP where there is decrease in OOSC over
the previous year, all the other provinces observed an increase in
the number of OOSC in the primary education. The percentage of OOSC
across the provinces varied from (19, 54) in FATA to (33, 37) in GB
for males and females respectively. In Punjab and AJK it is (22, 25)
while in Balochistan and Sindh percentages of (45, 63) and (23, 47)
are observed for males and females respectively (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:Perct-Dist-OOSC-Gender-Edu">4.6</a>).</p>
<p>OOSC in the middle level school education group also
had 3.665 million children with 1.553 (42%) and 2.111 (58%) million
males and females respectively. This is 28.33 percent of the total
population at this age level showing even worse situation than observed
at primary level. This number shows a reduction of 43.74 percent at
this level of schooling over the previous year which is a good news.
This reduction was observed for all provinces with varying percentages.</p>
<p>OOSC in the high school education group showed 3.327
million children with 1.539 (46.25%) males and 1.788 (53.75%) females.
This is 39.97 percent of total population of this age group who are
OOSC. This number shows a reduction of 33.85 percent at this level
of schooling. This reduction was observed for all provinces with varying
percentages.</p>

<p>OOSC in the higher secondary level and TVET institutions
combined showed 4.777 million children with 2.310 million (48%) males
and 2.467 million (52%) females. Since there are a total of 8.101
million children in this age group which shows that 59 percent of
them are not going to school. However compared with the previous year
there is a reduction of 25 percent OOSC at this level of schooling
and technical/skill development education. This reduction was observed
for all provinces with varying percentages.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4.6: Percentage distribution of OOSC by Gender and Education levels for Provinces/Regions of Pakistan 2017-18
</p>
</div>
<p>For all classes in the age group (<span class="math inline">\(05-16^{+}\)</span> years) there were 17.808
million OOSC of which 7.840 million (44%) were males
and 9.968 million (56%) were females showing about 12 percent more
females OOSC as compared to males. This shows that about 33.86 percent
OOSC which means that one out of every three child does not attend
school during the school going age (<span class="math inline">\(05-16^{+}\)</span> years). Despite Government
efforts the situation still needs much attention from the education
departments to work for reducing the number of OOSC in females. This
gap between male and female has widened over the previous year when
it was about seven percent. There is need to make this gap closer
by providing incentives for female education. It may be appropriate
to describe that over the previous four academic years 2013-17 the
OOSC figures remained almost stagnant 24.816, 24.024, 22.634 and 22.844
million showing (-3, -6 and 1) percent change over the corresponding
previous year. In 2017-18 a decrease of 22.14 percent was observed
when the OOSC figure dropped to 17.808 million children from 2016-17.</p>
<p>The percentage distribution of OOSC by gender, education level and
provinces/regions of Pakistan is given in Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:Perct-Dist-OOSC-Gender-Edu">4.6</a>.
It is observed that at the national level from primary to higher secondary
level there is a gap of about 11 percent showing more females (40%)
are OOSC as compared to males (29%). This gap is quite small in Punjab,
GB, AJK and ICT, while it is quite large in FATA, KP, Sindh, and Balochistan.
Similar pattern with varying percentages is also visible at different
stages of education. Major reason for this disparity is due to the
cultural barriers in the society which can only be removed through
better awareness through media and other means of communication and
concerted efforts by the provincial/regional governments.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Survival Rate (SR) to Grade V, VIII and X</h3>
<p>Survival Rate also called Retention Rate,
is the proportion of a cohort of pupils who reached Grade-V expressed
as a percentage of pupils enrolled in the first grade of a given cycle
in a given school year.</p>
<p>A Survival Rate approaching 100 percent indicates a high level of
retention and low dropout incidence. Survival Rate may vary from grade
to grade, giving indications of grades with relatively more or less
dropouts. The distinction between survival rate with and without repetition
is necessary to compare the extent of wastage due to dropout and repetition.
Survival rates reported here are based on without repetition.</p>
<p>An overall survival rate of 63 percent to Grade-V in primary education
was observed which was 67 and 59 percent for males and females respectively.
In the provinces it was lower for Sindh (57%) and higher in Punjab
(67%). In the regions a lowest value of 42 percent was observed for
FATA with gender discrepancy of 56 and 21 percent for males and females
respectively. In AJK and GB it was more than 70 percent while in ICT
it was observed to be hundred percent for both sexes. The national
GPI of survival to Grade-V was observed at 0.87 with highest in Punjab
(1.04) favouring female students while it was lowest in FATA (0.38)
in favour of males.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Pupil Teacher, Pupil School, and Teacher School Ratios</h3>
<p>PTR, PSR, and TSR are one of the
most common indicators used in educational planning. A low number
of pupils per teacher indicate pupils will have a better chance of
contact with the teachers and hence an improved teaching-learning
process. The PTR should normally be compared to the established national
norms on the number of pupils per teacher for each level or type of
education. A high pupil-teacher ratio suggests that each teacher has
to deal with a large number of pupils and that, conversely, pupils
receive less attention from the teacher. This affects quality of learning.</p>
<p>The ratio of students to teaching staff is also an important indicator
of the resources devoted to education by the government. Pupil teacher
ratio by education level and public/private sector for
Provinces/Regions is given in Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:PTR-Edu-Sector">4.11</a>. It
portrays that generally PTR are on the lower side at all levels in
the private sector. PTR in Public sector educational institutions
is almost double than that in the private sector at the primary level
which is a clear indicator of better availability of teachers to students
at the basic level of education. This disparity is even more acute
in Punjab and KP as compared to other Provinces/Regions. In Punjab
similar situation persist at higher levels of education.</p>

by sector and Provinces/Regions for 2017-18 is given in Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:STR-Sector">4.12</a>.
At national level the Pupil Teacher ratio was 29:18 for public and
private sector. This varied from as low as 17 in AJK to as high as
36 in FATA for public sector. The corresponding numbers for private
sector were 16 to 33 for Punjab, ICT, GB and FATA.</p>
<p>Pupil School ratio at national level was 158 and 212 for public and
private sectors respectively. This varied from as low as 67 in Balochistan
to as high as 496 in ICT for public sector schools. The corresponding
numbers for private sector were 178 in Punjab to 365 in FATA.</p>
<p>The Teacher School Ratio at the national level was 5 to 12. It was
always smaller for public sector school as compared to private sector
schools with the exception of ICT with 20 to 13 for public versus
private schools.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Pupil Classroom Ratio (PCR)</h3>
<p>PCR is an important indicator to measure the quality of
education at a particular level of education. A low pupil classroom
ratio is often perceived good. This means as enough classrooms are
available and less number of students in a classroom which facilitates
teachers to focus more on the needs of individual students, thus reducing
the amount of class time they spend dealing with disruptions.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> Availability of Electricity</h3>
<p>In the summer season, non-availability of electricity
affects the performance of teachers as well as students, especially
in the hot areas. The performance of schools having computer and science
labs are also severely affected by the non-availability of electricity.
Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:Avail-Elect-Edu">4.14</a> presents the status of availability
of electricity in schools of Pakistan. At national level the availability
of electricity in primary, middle, high, and higher secondary schools

<p>This is another essential facility which may become critical in female
schools. It has been observed that even when this facility is reported
to be available, there are many instances where the facility is un-usable
due to poor maintenance, and practically the schools are without this
facility. The percentage of availability are below percent in Balochistan,
AJK, FATA, and GB primary schools while in Punjab and ICT it was hundred
percent for all levels (Fig. <a href="effectiveness-of-education-system.html#fig:Avail-Toilet-Edu">4.16</a>).</p>
